"at ex.p3 were issued by him to the complainant, only as security, at the time of the alleged loan transaction in the year 2011 and",audio_3_32.mp3
"the accused has also failed to prove that, he has repaid the alleged loan of rs.30,000/- and that he has not taken any action against",audio_3_33.mp3

as the pronote at ex.p3 were issued by the accused towards the discharge of the legally enforceable debt and therefore the accused has successfully rebutted,audio_3_38.mp3
the presumption available in favour of the complainant and thus prayed for the acquittal of the accused. 12. I have considered the submissions and perused,audio_3_39.mp3
the record carefully. 13. Sec.138 of the NI Act  has been enacted to lend credibility to the financial transactions. The main ingredients of the,audio_3_40.mp3
"offence under S.  138 NI Act  are:- (i) drawing up of a cheque by the accused towards the payment of the amount of money,",audio_3_41.mp3
"for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or any other liability; (ii) return of the cheque by the bank as unpaid;",audio_3_42.mp3
(iii) the drawer of the cheque fails to make the payment of the said amount of money within 15 days of the receipt of the,audio_3_43.mp3
"notice under the proviso (b) to S.  138. The explanation appended to the S.  provides that, the ""debt or other liability"" for the purpose of",audio_3_44.mp3
"this S.  means a legally enforceable debt or other liability.sri.narayana shetty.v vs.  smt.n rukmini on 21 december, 2016",audio_3_45.mp3
"The holder of cheque in the following terms:- ""it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that:- the holder of a cheque received the",audio_3_46.mp3
"cheque, of the nature referred to in S.  138, for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability"". 15. Also,",audio_3_47.mp3
"S.  118 of the NI Act  states, ""until the contrary is proved, the following presumptions shall be made:- (a) that every negotiable instrument was",audio_3_48.mp3
"made or drawn for consideration and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred, was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred",audio_3_49.mp3
"for consideration;"" 16. Thus, the act clearly lays down the presumptions in favour of the complainant with regard to the issuance of the cheque by",audio_3_50.mp3
"the accused, towards the discharge of his liability in favour of the complainant. 17. Under the scheme of the act, the onus is upon the",audio_3_51.mp3
"accused to rebut the presumptions in favour of the complainant by raising a probable defence. 18. Such being the legal position, it would be pertinent",audio_3_52.mp3
to refer to the defences raised by the accused to rebut the presumptions in favour of the complainant in this Cas. . 19. The first defence,audio_3_53.mp3
"raised by the accused in this Cas.  is that, though her acquaintance with the W/O  the complainant is admitted, according to her, she never",audio_3_54.mp3
had any financial transaction with the complainant as alleged by him in the present Cas. . Likewise it is the defence of the accused after the,audio_3_55.mp3
death of the W/O  the complainant on 24.12.2009 there has been no contact between the complainant and her serf and moreover there was no,audio_3_56.mp3
necessity for her to avail any loan from the complainant in the year 2013 and according her the cheque in question had been issued by,audio_3_57.mp3
her to the W/O  the complainant as a security for the loan that she had availed from her and that she has cleared the,audio_3_58.mp3
said loan with the W/O  the complainant and the said cheque has now been misused by the complainant by filling up its contents in,audio_3_59.mp3
the year 2013 after the death of his wife. Therefore from the defence of the accused it is evident that she has admitted her financial,audio_3_60.mp3
transaction with the W/O  the complainant and has categorically denied her alleged financial transaction with the complainant. In such circumstance the burden is cast,audio_3_61.mp3
upon the complainant to prove the existence of such financial transaction by him with the accused. In this regard except his oral testimony there is,audio_3_62.mp3
no other material placed on record by the complainant. 20. Further it is pertinent to note that according to the complainant he has allegedly advanced,audio_3_63.mp3
"a loan of rs.80,000/- to the accused on 05.05.2013 and that after the expiry of the stipulated period of 2 months, upon his demand the",audio_3_64.mp3
accused has issued the cheque in question to him. While during his cross examination the complainant has stated that the accused has issued the cheque,audio_3_65.mp3
"at ex.p-1sri.narayana shetty.v vs.  smt.n rukmini on 21 december, 2016",audio_3_66.mp3
"Presence, but he does not know as to who has filled up the contents of the said cheque. Thus there is a clear contradiction in",audio_3_67.mp3
the evidence of the complainant with regard to the time of the alleged issuance of the cheque by the accused in his favour. Though this,audio_3_68.mp3
"is not a serious contradiction, it gives rise to a suspicious circumstance in the Cas.  of the complainant, which creates a doubt in the mind",audio_3_69.mp3
"of this court about the Cas.  of the complainant. 21. The complainant has misused according to the accused, the cheque in question after the death",audio_3_70.mp3
of his wife by filling up its contents and presenting the same before the bank. According to her she had financial transactions with the wife,audio_3_71.mp3
"of the complainant, but she has cleared the entire transaction in respect of ex.p-1 before 2009 and the W/O  the complainant has also issued",audio_3_72.mp3
"an endorsement in this regard both to her as well as to one bhagya, against whom the complainant had filed a similar cheque bounce Cas. .",audio_3_73.mp3
22. To fortify this defence version the accused has confronted the documents at ex.d-1 to d-8 to pw-1 which are as follows:- ex. D-1 is,audio_3_74.mp3
"the certified copy of the judgement in cc no.6790/15 which was a cheque bounce Cas.  filed by the present complainant against one smt. Bhagya b.t,",audio_3_75.mp3
"who is admittedly the friend of his wife, ex.d-2 to d-4 are the endorsements said to have been issued by the complainant as well his",audio_3_76.mp3
"wife to the accused, to smt. Bhagya b t and to one kumar, by virtue of which, the complainant and his wife are said to",audio_3_77.mp3
have received the entire amount due from the aforesaid persons and having undertaken to return the cheques mentioned therein. In the said documents there is,audio_3_78.mp3
"mention of even the cheque at ex.1. Ex.d-5 is a receipt in which pw-1 has admitted his signature as per ex.d5(a), by virtue of which",audio_3_79.mp3
"he has admitted having received rs.5,000/- towards the funeral expenses of his wife from her Dept.  and ex.d-6 is the attested copy in respect of",audio_3_80.mp3
"the funeral expenses incurred by the complainant towards his wife on 24.12.2009, ex.d-7 is the attested copy of the nomination for the karnataka Govt.  employees",audio_3_81.mp3
family benefit funds in which the name of the complainant is shown as the nominee on 12.09.1998 in which he has identified the signature as,audio_3_82.mp3
that of his wife as per ex.d-7(a). Ex.d-8 is the certified copy of the chief examination Aff.  and the cross-examination of the complainant in cc,audio_3_83.mp3
"no.6790/15. 23. By placing reliance upon these documentary evidence, it is the defence of the accused that after the death of his wife the complainant",audio_3_84.mp3
has received all her statutory benefits from the Govt.  and even though before the death of his wife she has cleared her loan amount as,audio_3_85.mp3
"per the documents at ex.d-2 to d-4, by misusing the cheque in question which was issued as a signed blank cheque by her to his",audio_3_86.mp3
"wife only for the purpose of security, the present false Cas.  has been filed against her. No doubt if the complainant has denied the documentary",audio_3_87.mp3
"evidence at ex.d-2 to d-4, the burden is upon the accused to prove the same. However, it is pertinent to note that the complainant has",audio_3_88.mp3
"not denied the entire contents of the said documents, since he has admitted his signatures as per ex.d-3(a) and d-5(a). In such situation the onus",audio_3_89.mp3
"is once again shifted to the complainant to explain before thesri.narayana shetty.v vs.  smt.n rukmini on 21 december, 2016",audio_3_90.mp3
The attempt on the part of the complainant in this regard is nil. Therefore the complainant cannot be permitted to claim that the said documents,audio_3_91.mp3
"are created and concocted documents. 24. Likewise in ex.d-8 the complainant has claimed that he has advanced a loan of rs.50,000/- to one smt. Bhagya",audio_3_92.mp3
"b.t on 10.05.2013 and that towards the repayment of the same she had issued a post dated cheque bearing no.950026 dated 15.07.2013 for rs.50,000/- and",audio_3_93.mp3
that he had presented the same for encashment on 15.07.2013 and that the same came to be bounced on 17.07.2013 and thereafter he got issued,audio_3_94.mp3
a legal notice to the said bhagya on 26.07.2013. Interestingly the said cheque No.  also finds place in ex.d-2 to d-4 relied upon by the,audio_3_95.mp3

issuing of the cheque. In order to prove the said fact accused produced chit pass book marked as ex.d1 and voucher for the payment of,audio_4_93.mp3
"rs.19,000/- to the complainant Co.  on dt:07.12.2013. In the cross examination of dw1 the complainant taken the contention that the entries in the pass book",audio_4_94.mp3
in the ex.d1 is filled as per the convenience by the accused and the said payment entries do not with any documentary receipts regarding payment.,audio_4_95.mp3
"The contents of ex.d2 is admitted by the complainant which discloses an amount of rs.19,000/- has been paid to the complainant Co.  by accused whichu/s",audio_4_96.mp3
"200 of cr.p.c for the offence vs.  was read over and explained which was on 3 february, 2020",audio_4_97.mp3
Has not produced any receipts which corroborates the payment made to the complainant as entered in ex.d1. In the absence of the receipts the contention,audio_4_98.mp3
of the accused that he has repaid the entire amount to the complainant Co.  cannot be considered and accepted. It is a Cas.  of the,audio_4_99.mp3
accused that inspite of payment of entire amount the complainant has not returned the cheques with they are obtained at the time of subscription of,audio_4_100.mp3
the chit and by misusing the same by making entries as per their convenience in the said cheque has filed false complaint against them. It,audio_4_101.mp3
is vehemently agued by the complainant counsel that in the cross examination dw1 has clearly admitted that he has not obtained the noc certificate after,audio_4_102.mp3
clearing the chit amount nor he has taken any attempt to obtain the same. In this Cas.  also it is crystal clear that the accused,audio_4_103.mp3
has not produced any single document to show that he has made attempt to obtain the noc after clearing the chit amount when there was,audio_4_104.mp3
no impediment for the accused to apply the same if at all he has cleared the entire chit amount. But in this Cas.  not a,audio_4_105.mp3
single document has been produced by the accused to show that he has taken necessary steps to obtain noc from the complainant Co.  and also,audio_4_106.mp3
requested the complainant to return the 7 cheques which according to him has been handed as security at the time of obtaining the chit amount.,audio_4_107.mp3
In the absence of the same it creates a suspicious regarding the defence taken by the accused that he has cleared the entire chit amount,audio_4_108.mp3
and there was no legal enforceable debt on the date of presentation of the cheque. In the cross examination of pw1 it is contended by,audio_4_109.mp3
"the accused that there was a difference of amount mentioned in the document on demand promissory note ex.p11, notice ex.p8 and bank memo ex.p7 for",audio_4_110.mp3
which the complainant/pw1 deposed that there is a difference in ex.p11 on demand promissory note and ex.p5 memo of calculation since the principal amount and,audio_4_111.mp3
interest is shown in ex.p5 and in exp11 is only the principal amount. It is pertinent to note that in the absence of cogent evidence,audio_4_112.mp3
and relevant document that the accused has paid the entire chit amount cannot be taken into consideration. Further the contention of the accused that there,audio_4_113.mp3
is difference the amount shown in the on demand promissory note and the memo of calculation also cannot be taken into consideration in the absence,audio_4_114.mp3
of cogent and relevant document by the accused/dw1. On appreciating the cross examination of pw1 it is found that accused counsel had taken Anr.  contention,audio_4_115.mp3
that the signature ex.p6(a) differs with the signature of the accused in the chit agreement ex.p4. This contention of the accused in the cross examination,audio_4_116.mp3
cannot be appreciated in the absence of cogent evidence and relevant document to show that the signature ex.p6(a) does not belong to the accused. It,audio_4_117.mp3
is also equally important to note that in the evidence of dw1 the accused has clearly admitted that he was the subscriber of the chit,audio_4_118.mp3
and has never disputed his signature on the chit agreement ex.p4. In the absence of relevant document the contention of the accused that the signature,audio_4_119.mp3
in ex.p4 chit agreement does not resemble with the signature in the disputed cheque ex.p6(a). On analyzing and appreciating the evidence put forth by the,audio_4_120.mp3
accused it is found that no substantial evidence has been placed by the accused to disprove his signature ex.p6(a) on the disputed cheque. Further in,audio_4_121.mp3
the cross examination of pw1 by the accused counsel it is also contended that the ink that has been used in filling the disputed cheque,audio_4_122.mp3
ex.p6 and the signature ex.p6(a) of the accused are different and the said contents with the signature of the accused is filled by the complainant,audio_4_123.mp3
as per their convenience. The said facts have been denied by the complainant/pw1 by contending that accused has issued the disputed cheque ex.p6 with signature,audio_4_124.mp3
ex.p6(a) in discharge of legal debt and liability. It is found that accused also contended that the cheque which has been issued for security has,audio_4_125.mp3
been misused by the complainant by filling it as per the convenience and filing a false complaint against him. On thisu/s 200 of cr.p.c for,audio_4_126.mp3
"the offence vs.  was read over and explained which was on 3 february, 2020",audio_4_127.mp3
When cheque has been issued in discharge of legal debt and liability there is no impediment on the part of the complainant to fill the,audio_4_128.mp3
content of the said cheque and present it for collection. In the instant Cas.  in the absence of cogent and documentary evidence the contention of,audio_4_129.mp3
"the accused that the signature ex.p6(a) on the said cheque does not belong to accused cannot be taken into consideration and accepted. Per contra, the",audio_4_130.mp3
complainant has proved that in discharge of legal debt and liability accused had issued the disputed cheque ex.p6 with signature on the disputed cheque ex.p6(a).,audio_4_131.mp3

"This ruling is applicable to the present facts and circumstances of the Cas.  since in para-36, 37, 38 & 40 the Hon'ble  SC  has",audio_4_147.mp3
clearly laid down the dictum of law that the onus to rebut the presumption u/s 139 that the cheque has been issued in discharge of,audio_4_148.mp3
a debt or liability is on the accused and the fact that the cheque may be post dated does not absolve the drawer of the,audio_4_149.mp3
cheque of a penal consequences of sec.138 of the n.i act. 14. On perusal of the said ruling the Hon'ble  SC  had made it,audio_4_150.mp3
"very clear that if a signed blank cheque is voluntarily presented to a payee, towards some payment, the payee may fill of the amount and",audio_4_151.mp3
other particulars and it would not invalidate the cheque. The onus would still be on the accused to prove that the cheque was not in,audio_4_152.mp3
"discharge of debt or liability by adducing evidence. It is further held that even blank cheque leaf, voluntarily signed and handed over by the accused,",audio_4_153.mp3
"which is towards some payment, would attract presumption u/s 139 of the negotiable instrument act, in the absence of any cogent evidence to show that",audio_4_154.mp3
"the cheque was not issued in discharge of a debt. It is also held that the provisions of sec.20, 87 and 139 makes it amply",audio_4_155.mp3
clear that a person who signs a cheque and makes it over to the payee remains liable unless he adduces evidence to rebut the presumption,audio_4_156.mp3
that the cheque had been issued for payment of a debt or in discharge of a liability. It is immaterial that the cheque may have,audio_4_157.mp3
"been filled in by any person other than the drawer, if the cheque is duly signed by the drawer. In view of the dictum of",audio_4_158.mp3
law laid down by the Hon'ble  SC  the contention of the accused that the cheque ex.p6 has been filled as per their convenience and,audio_4_159.mp3
filed a false complaint cannot be considered and accepted. In the instant Cas.  accused had utterly failed to rebut the presumption that there exist no,audio_4_160.mp3
"legal enforceable debt and they were not in due of payment of rs.3,85,000/- mentioned in the cheque ex.p6. 15. In the instant Cas.  the complainant",audio_4_161.mp3
deposed that in discharge of legal debt and liability accused has issued ex.p6/cheque which on presentation to the bank was returned as dishonored with the,audio_4_162.mp3
reason stop payment by the accused as per the bank memo ex.p7. In the chief examination of dw1 he deposed that the representatives of the,audio_4_163.mp3
complainant approached his house and threatened him that they would file a cheque bounce Cas.  against him for the said reason he had issued stop,audio_4_164.mp3
payment intimation to the bank. From this admission of dw1 it is crystal clear that the accused himself after issuing of the cheque has intimated,audio_4_165.mp3
the bank for stop payment. To substantiate his defence accused has not produced a single document to show that he had taken legal action against,audio_4_166.mp3
the complainant representative for threatening him nor he has produced any cogent evidence the representative of the complainant Co.  approached his house and intimated him,audio_4_167.mp3
that they would to be file a cheque bounce Cas.  against him. In view of the same the contention of the accused regarding the said,audio_4_168.mp3
fact cannot be considered and accepted. 16. At this juncture i would also like to discuss the dictum of law laid down in (2003) 3,audio_4_169.mp3
"SC  cases 232 (goaplast (p) ltd, v/s chico ursula d' souza and anr) in this judgment the Hon'ble  SC  has laid down the",audio_4_170.mp3
dictum of law that the drawer issuing to a person of post dated cheque and then instructing the bank not to make payment consequently cheque,audio_4_171.mp3
bounce in such circumstances not withstanding the payment stopped prior to the due date of the cheque date held sec.138 become applicable. Further it is,audio_4_172.mp3
held that if stoppage of payment before the due date of theu/s 200 of cr.p.c for the offence vs.  was read over and explained which,audio_4_173.mp3
"was on 3 february, 2020",audio_4_174.mp3
Confidence which cheque is otherwise intended to inspire regarding payment being available on due date this ruling is aptly applicable to the present fact and,audio_4_175.mp3
circumstances of the Cas.  since it is clearly admitted by the accused in his evidence that he has instructed the bank for stop payment of,audio_4_176.mp3
the cheque but he has not produced any evidence to show that on the date of issuing of the cheque he has sufficient balance in,audio_4_177.mp3
his account and if at all he had not issued the instruction of stop payment definitely the disputed cheque would have been honoured. 17. The,audio_4_178.mp3
"complainant counsel has relied on a ruling reported in : (1996) 2 SC  cases 739 electronics trade & technology development corpn ltd, secunderabad v/s",audio_4_179.mp3
indian technologists & engineers (electronics) (p) ltd and Anr.  on perusal of the said ruling it is found that the Hon'ble  SC  has clearly,audio_4_180.mp3
laid down the dictum of law that the drawer of the cheque having insufficient fund in his credit cannot escaped liability u/s 138 by issuing,audio_4_181.mp3
stop payment instruction to his bank. It is clearly held that before presenting of the cheque for encashment if he had requested the complainant not,audio_4_182.mp3
to present before the bank by issuing notice then the provisions of sec.138 would not have been attracted even though the cheque is return by,audio_4_183.mp3
the bank. In the instant Cas.  accused not issued any notice or intimated the complainant before the cheque was presented for the bank nor he,audio_4_184.mp3
has produced documentary evidence to show that on the date of dishonour of cheque there was sufficient balance in his account to honour the cheque,audio_4_185.mp3
and the said cheque has been dishonoured only due to his instruction of stop payment. The Hon'ble  SC  in the said ruling has clearly,audio_4_186.mp3
held that once the cheque has been drawn and issued to the payee and the payee has presented the cheque and there after if any,audio_4_187.mp3
instructions are issued to the bank for non payment and the cheque is returned to the payee with such an endorsement it amount to dishonour,audio_4_188.mp3
cheque and it comes a meaning of sec.138 of n.i act. It is also held in para-6 that sec.138 intend to prevent dishonest on the,audio_4_189.mp3
part of the drawer of negotiable instrument to draw a cheque without sufficient funds in his account maintained by him in a bank and induce,audio_4_190.mp3
the payee or holder in due course to act upon it. Sec.138 draw presumption that one commits the offence if issues the cheque dishonestly. Under,audio_4_191.mp3
this circumstances since the accused has not paid the payment within 15 days from the date of the receipt of the notice issued by the,audio_4_192.mp3
payee or the holder in due course the dishonest intention is inferable from those facts. From the above reasons and discussion it is found that,audio_4_193.mp3
the dictum of law laid down by the Hon'ble  SC  has aptly applicable to the present facts and circumstances of the Cas. . 18. In,audio_4_194.mp3
the instant Cas.  the complainant counsel vehemently argued that if at all the accused has made the payment definitely he would have approach the complainant,audio_4_195.mp3
for return of the 7 cheque which he has deposited for security and not making any attempt by issuing a notice to the complainant to,audio_4_196.mp3
return the cheques for more than five years is quite unnatural. According to the accused he had issued the 7 cheques for security at the,audio_4_197.mp3
time of obtaining the chit amount which is inu/s 200 of cr.p.c for the offence vs.  was read over and explained which was on 3,audio_4_198.mp3
"february, 2020",audio_4_199.mp3
And the payment voucher is also dated on the same date. If the contention of the accused is considered then according to him he had,audio_4_200.mp3
issued 7 cheques for security in the year 2012 till the date of filing of the complaint on 17.05.2016 for a period of 4 years,audio_4_201.mp3
he has never issued any notice to the complainant to return the said cheques. On this point the complainant relied on citation of Hon'ble  supreme,audio_4_202.mp3
"court reported in : air 2018 SC  3601 t.p murugan (dead) lrs v/s bojan posa nandhi rep.thr poa holder, t.p murugan vs.  bojan negotiable",audio_4_203.mp3
"instruments act (26 of 1881), s.138, s.139 dishonour of cheque- presumption as to enforceable debt- cheques allegedly issued by accused towards repayment of debt-defence of",audio_4_204.mp3
accused that 10 cheques issued towards repayment of loan bank in 1995- behavior of accused in allegedly issued 10 blank cheques back in 1995 and,audio_4_205.mp3
"never asking their return for 7 years, unnatural-accused admitting his signature on cheques and pronote presumption under s.139 would operate against him - complainant proving",audio_4_206.mp3
"existence of legally enforceable debt and issuance of cheques towards discharge of debt-conviction, proper. This ruling is aptly applicable to the present Cas.  since the",audio_4_207.mp3
accused does not dispute his signature on pronote on ex.11 nor on the payment voucher ex.p13 dated:28.12.2012. If the defence of the accused is considered,audio_4_208.mp3
then according to the accused he had issued 7 blank cheque at the time of obtaining the chit amount on 28.12.2012 and never asked the,audio_4_209.mp3
return of the cheque for 4 years which appears to be quite unnatural. 19. Accused counsel has produced the ruling reported in : 2005 crl.l.j,audio_4_210.mp3
"269 madras HC  sri. Murugan financiers v/s p.v. Perumal NI Act  (26 of 1881), s.138- dishonour of cheque- appeal against acquittal - complaint-",audio_4_211.mp3
complainant being a finance Co.  no books of account produced in support of claim- order acquitting accused on finding that complainant has not proved debt,audio_4_212.mp3
or legally enforceable liability satisfactorily and cheque was in fact issued as guarantee- not interfered with Crl.  p.c. On perusal of the said ruling it,audio_4_213.mp3
is said that the Hon'ble  HC  had laid down the dictum of law that if no account books are produced in support of their,audio_4_214.mp3
claim if the complainant has not proved the debt or legally enforceable liability satisfactorily then accused is entitle for acquittal. In the instant Cas.  this,audio_4_215.mp3
ruling does not support the Cas.  of the accused since there is clear admission accused/dw1 that he was the member of the chit and has,audio_4_216.mp3
obtained a prize amount as a subscriber. Further in this Cas.  the complainant has produced the relevant document chit agreement ex.p4 and account statement ex.p3,audio_4_217.mp3
disclosing that accused has not repaid the chit amount. 20. Accused has also relied on Anr.  ruling reported in:u/s 200 of cr.p.c for the offence,audio_4_218.mp3
"vs.  was read over and explained which was on 3 february, 2020",audio_4_219.mp3
Perusal of this ruling it is found that the Hon'ble  HC  has laid down the dictum of law that if no consideration is passed,audio_4_220.mp3
in favour of the accused presumption under Cl.  (a) of sec.118(a) stands rebutted. This ruling is also not applicable to the facts and circumstances of,audio_4_221.mp3
the Cas.  and does not support the Cas.  of the accused. On perusal of the evidence on record it satisfactorily establish that the complainant has,audio_4_222.mp3
pay the prize amount to the accused. The said fact is clearly admitted by the accused/dw1 in chief examination where he had deposed that he,audio_4_223.mp3
"was a chit member in the complainant firm and after successful bidding has obtained a chit amount of rs.3,50,000/- but failed to prove that he",audio_4_224.mp3
has repaid the same. 21. Further the accused has also relied ruling reported in : ilr 2008 kar 3635 k. Narayana nayak v/s sri. M.,audio_4_225.mp3
Shivarama shetty on perusal of the said rulings it is found that in both the ruling the Hon'ble  HC  has held that if the,audio_4_226.mp3
cheque issued by the accused is only as a security and not for discharge of any existing debt is entitle for acquittal. 2015 (5)kccr 990,audio_4_227.mp3
karnataka HC  l. Raju v/s gurappa reddy in this ruling the Hon'ble  HC  has held that if the complainant fails to establish the,audio_4_228.mp3
legal enforceable debt and the disputed cheque issued for the discharge of legal enforceable debt then accused is entitle for acquittal. 22. Both the dictum,audio_4_229.mp3
of law laid down in both rulings is not applicable to the present facts and circumstances of the Cas.  since the complainant overwhelmingly has proved,audio_4_230.mp3
behind all reasonable doubt from the above reasons and discussions that their exist legal enforceable debt and in discharge of the same accused has issued,audio_4_231.mp3
"the disputed cheque ex.p6 in favour of the complainant. Per contra, accused has utterly failed to prove that he has issued 7 cheques for security",audio_4_232.mp3
which has been misused by the complainant in filing a false complaint. 23. At this juncture i would also like to discuss the citation reported,audio_4_233.mp3
"in air 2018 Hon'ble  SC  3601 (t.p murugan (dead) thr.lrs.v bojan and posa nandhi rep.thr, poa holder, t.p murugan vs.  bojan) in this ruling",audio_4_234.mp3
"at para-8 the Hon'ble  SC  has laid down the dictum of law that u/s 139 of the n.i act, once a cheque has been",audio_4_235.mp3
"signed and issued in favour of the holder, there is statutory presumption that it is issued in discharge of a legally enforceable debt or liability",audio_4_236.mp3
"by referring to k.n.beena v/s muniyappan and Anr. , (2001) 8 scc 458, para-6 and rangappa v/s shrimohan (2010) 11 scc 411, para 26 . It",audio_4_237.mp3
"is further held that the presumption is a rebuttable one, if the issuer of the cheque is able to discharge the burden that it was",audio_4_238.mp3
issued for some other purpose like security for a loan. The dictum of law laid down by Hon'ble  SC  in this Cas.  is aptly,audio_4_239.mp3
applicable to the fact and circumstances of the present Cas.  since accused has utterly failed to rebut the presumption u/s 139 of n.i act existing,audio_4_240.mp3
"in favour of the complainant that the cheque ex.p6 issued by him is not for discharge of any legal debt or liability. Per contra, the",audio_4_241.mp3
"complainant has proved the Cas.  byu/s 200 of cr.p.c for the offence vs.  was read over and explained which was on 3 february, 2020",audio_4_242.mp3
Debt regarding the repayment of the chit amount. In the above said ruling the Hon'ble  SC  has also clearly laid down the dictum of,audio_4_243.mp3
law that the behavior of the accused is also prominent while appreciating the entire evidence. In the instant Cas.  by appreciating the entire evidence it,audio_4_244.mp3
is found that he has been subjected to harassment by the Co.  representatives for which he had intimated the bank officials for stop payment of,audio_4_245.mp3
the cheque. But failed to prove the said fact by producing cogent evidence and relevant document that he has been subjected to harassment by the,audio_4_246.mp3
Co.  representatives. The behavior of the accused clearly goes to show that intentionally after issuing of the cheque for the discharge of legal debt have,audio_4_247.mp3
intimated the bank for the stop payment of the said cheque. Further has not produced any relevant document regarding the payment of the entire chit,audio_4_248.mp3
amount inspite of taking the defence that there was no due from him to the complainant Co.  at the time of presentation of the disputed,audio_4_249.mp3
cheque for collection to the bank. From all these reason it is crystal clear that accused is not entitle for any relief u/s 138 of,audio_4_250.mp3
n.i act. 24. It is the evidence of pw1 that after receiving the memo from the bank regarding dishonour of cheque issued notice on 24.03.2016,audio_4_251.mp3
through rpad and the said notice has been served on the accused. In order to prove the said fact the complainant has produced the notice,audio_4_252.mp3
ex.p8 and the postal receipt ex.p8(a) for having send the notice through rpad also produced reciept ex.p8(b) to show that notice is also served through,audio_4_253.mp3
courier service. Further the complainant has also produced the postal acknowledgment ex.p9 to show that the said notice sent to the proper address of the,audio_4_254.mp3
accused has been duly served and acknowledged by the accused. It is pertinent to note that accused /dw1 in his evidence never deposed that he,audio_4_255.mp3
has not received the legal notice ex.p8 as per the acknowledgment ex.p9 and never disputed his signature on the postal acknowledgement ex.p9. From this documentary,audio_4_256.mp3
evidence it is clearly established that the complainant has issued the notice to the proper address of the accused and the same has been acknowledged,audio_4_257.mp3
by the accused as per the pastel acknowledgment ex.p9. 25. At this juncture on this point regarding service of notice i would like to reproduce,audio_4_258.mp3
the principle laid down by the Hon'ble  apex court of india in a decision reported in 2007 (3) crimes 120 (SC  ) (c.c. Alavi,audio_4_259.mp3
"haji v/s palapetty muhammed & anr), 2007 air scw 3578 (c.c.avavi haji v/s palapetty muhammed & anor). On perusal the said ruling it is found",audio_4_260.mp3
that the Hon'ble  SC  held at para- 8 that : sec.138 of the act does not require that the notice should be given only,audio_4_261.mp3
"by 'post', yet in a Cas.  where the sender as a dispatched the notice by post with correct address written on it, the principle Inc. ",audio_4_262.mp3
in S.  27 of the general Cl.  act 1897 (for short gc act) could profitably be imported in such a Cas. . It was held that,audio_4_263.mp3
in this situation service of notice is deemed to have been affected on the sendee unless he proves that it was not really served and,audio_4_264.mp3
that he was not responsible for such non service. Further at para -10 it is held that : the requirement of Cl.  (b) of the,audio_4_265.mp3
provisions of sec.138 of the act stands complied with and cause of action to file a complaint arises on the expiry of the period prescribed,audio_4_266.mp3
in Cl.  (c) of the said proviso to sec.138 for payment by the drawer of the cheque. Nevertheless it would beu/s 200 of cr.p.c for,audio_4_267.mp3
"the offence vs.  was read over and explained which was on 3 february, 2020",audio_4_268.mp3
The notice are brought to his address. This ruling is aptly applicable to the present Cas.  on the hand since the notice ex.p8 is duly,audio_4_269.mp3
served through acknowledgment ex.p9 to the proper address of the accused. It is pertinent to note that if notice sent through rpad by correctly addressing,audio_4_270.mp3
"drawer of the cheque, mandatory requirement of issue of notice in terms of (b) of proviso to u/s 138 of n.i. Act stands complied with.",audio_4_271.mp3
The evidence on record clearly establishes that the complainant sent the notice to the accused to the correct address through rpad and the same is,audio_4_272.mp3
duly served to the accused on his proper address. In view of the same in the instant Cas.  sending legal notice to the correct address,audio_4_273.mp3
of the accused is found to be in compliance with u/s 138(b) of n.i. Act by the complainant. 26. Non-initiating the legal action for alleged,audio_4_274.mp3
"misutilization, non-intimating to his banker and non- issuance of reply are the strongest circumstances to draw inference against the accused. As noted supra it is",audio_4_275.mp3
settled that the presumption has to be rebutted by cogent proof and not by a bare explanation which is merely plausible. On appreciation of material,audio_4_276.mp3
"on record in the considered opinion of this court, the evidence placed on record by the accused is not sufficient to rebut presumption. Hence, it",audio_4_277.mp3
cannot be said that the accused has rebutted the presumption. 27. The word 'unless contrary is proved' is discussed by the Hon'ble  apex court in,audio_4_278.mp3
"a decision reported in 2011 Crl.  l.j 4647 (SC  ). It is observed that ""the accused is under the obligation to prove his Cas. ",audio_4_279.mp3
"in trial by leading cogent evidence that there was no debt or liability to the satisfaction of the court"". 'unless contrary is proved' means the",audio_4_280.mp3
presumption has to be rebutted by proof and not by a bare explanation which is mere plausible. The said fact is said to be proved,audio_4_281.mp3
when its existence is directly established or when upon the material before it the court finds its existence to be so probable that the reasonable,audio_4_282.mp3
"man could act on the supposition that it exist. Therefore, unless explanation is supported by proof, the presumption created by the provisions cannot be said",audio_4_283.mp3
to be rebutted. On appreciation of material on record and in the light of the judgments discussed above it is clearly established that the accused,audio_4_284.mp3
"has failed to discharge his obligation to rebut the presumption of enforceable debt -liability under S.  139 of the n.i act. Accordingly, i have no",audio_4_285.mp3
"hesitation to arrive at the conclusion that accused has utterly failed to rebut the presumption. 28. On appreciation of entire evidence, this court is of",audio_4_286.mp3
the opinion that the accused has miserably failed to prove the fact that he has not issued cheque for discharge of legally enforceable debt. On,audio_4_287.mp3
"the contrary, the complainant has proved that the accused has issued cheque/ex.p6 for a sum of rs.3,85,000/- towards discharge of legally enforceable debt and on",audio_4_288.mp3

"of legal notice, the accused has not replied the notice and repaid the cheque amount. Hence, in the considered view of this court, the complainant",audio_4_290.mp3
"has complied the provisions of sec.142 and S.  138 of n.i. Act. Hence, i answer the above point no.1 in the affirmative.u/s 200 of cr.p.c",audio_4_291.mp3

in such a situation to honour the contract of insurance? there is no dispute that the insurer is liable as against third parties because it,audio_7_12.mp3
is covered by the statutory provisions contained in chapter x of the motor vehicles act 1988. But the insurer vehemently disputed the liability when the,audio_7_13.mp3
"claim is made by the insured himself or his legal heirs, without any third party being involved. To avoid confusion we may point out that",audio_7_14.mp3
"the insurance Co.  has no dispute that the claims, if any, made by the kith and kin of the insured for the injuries sustained by",audio_7_15.mp3
them in the accident including the claims made by the legal representatives of the deceased in such accident would also be treated as third party,audio_7_16.mp3

last day in the year 1993 became the last day of the insured as well as his maruti car because the insured died and the,audio_7_23.mp3
car was completely damaged in an accident which occurred on 31.12.1993. On 10.1.1994 the bank on which the cheque was drawn by the insured sent,audio_7_24.mp3
an intimation to the insurance Co.  that the cheque was dishonoured as there was no funds in the account of the insured. On 20.1.1994 the,audio_7_25.mp3
"insurance Co.  informed the business concern of the insured as under: notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary, it is hereby agreed and declared that your",audio_7_26.mp3
cheque has been dishonoured by the bank. So we are cancelling the above said policy with immediate effect. The Co.  is not at risk. The,audio_7_27.mp3
"respondents who are the widow and children of the insured, who died in the accident, filed a claim for the loss of the vehicle. When",audio_7_28.mp3
"the claim was repudiated, the respondents moved the state consumer protection commission. As per a judgment pronounced by the commission the said claim was rejected.",audio_7_29.mp3
"The judicial member of the state commission, who delivered the judgment, has stated thus: in so far the facts of the present Cas.  are concerned,",audio_7_30.mp3

In time and soon after the cheque bounced. In this view of the matter there is no need for us to go to any other,audio_7_35.mp3
"point that may arise in this Cas. . When the respondents (legal heirs of the insured) moved the HC  of jammu and kashmir, the division",audio_7_36.mp3
bench which heard the matter reversed the order passed by the state consumer commission and held the insurance Co.  liable to honour the claim. The,audio_7_37.mp3
division bench directed the state commission to assess the compensation in accordance with law and pay the same after deducting the amount of premium (as,audio_7_38.mp3
the cheque was dishonoured). The following reasoning was mainly adopted by the learned judge of the division bench for holding that the insurance Co.  is,audio_7_39.mp3
"liable on the fact situation: while ordering the cancellation of policy in question, respondent insurance Co.  instead of cancelling the same due to dishonour of",audio_7_40.mp3
"cheque of the premium from the date it was issued i.e. 21.12.1993, chose to cancel it with immediate effect. This clearly indicates that till the",audio_7_41.mp3
"issuance of this communication respondent insurance Co.  itself treated the policy subsisting. Besides this, it had not chosen to treat the same cancelled from the",audio_7_42.mp3
"date of issue. In the face of this position, this Cas.  need not detain us any further and for this reason the argument addressed on",audio_7_43.mp3
behalf of the insurance Co.  based on S.  64- vb of the insurance act also does not hold good. There was nothing which prevented the,audio_7_44.mp3
"insurance Co.  to have informed the appellants that the policy stood cancelled from the date of its issuance, and as such it is not liable",audio_7_45.mp3
for the payment of any compensation. The direction that insurance Co.  can now deduct the premium amount from the compensation to be fixed is no,audio_7_46.mp3
solace to the insurer. The essence of the insurance business is the coverage of the risk by undertaking to indemnify the insured against loss or,audio_7_47.mp3
damage. They agree to pay the damages arising out of any accident by taking a chance that no accident might happen. Motivation of the insurance,audio_7_48.mp3
business is that the premium would turn to be the profit of the business in Cas.  no damage occurs. Such business of the insurance Co. ,audio_7_49.mp3
"can be carried on only with the premium paid by the insured persons on the insurance policy. The only profit, if at all the insurance",audio_7_50.mp3
"Co.  makes, of the insurance business is the premium paid when no accident or damage occurs. But to ask the insurance Co.  to bear the",audio_7_51.mp3
"entire loss of damages of somebody else without the Co.  receiving a pie towards premium is contrary to the principles of equity, though the insurance",audio_7_52.mp3
"companies are made liable to third parties on account of statutory compulsions due to the initial agreement, entered between the insured and the Co.  concerned.",audio_7_53.mp3
A three-judge bench in oriental insurance co. Ltd. vs.  . Inderjit kaur (1998 (1) scc 371) left this point unconsidered. In that Cas.  also the,audio_7_54.mp3
premium was paid by cheque which was later dishonoured and the insured was intimated about it by the insurance Co.  two months after the vehicle,audio_7_55.mp3
"got involved in the accident. When a claim wasnational insurance Co.  ltd vs.  seema malhotra and ors on 20 february, 2001",audio_7_56.mp3
"Resisted the claim on the strength of S.  64-vb of the insurance act of 1938. Repelling the contention of the insurance Co. , the three-judge bench",audio_7_57.mp3
"held thus: we have, therefore, this position. Despite the bar created by S.  64- vb of the insurance act, the appellant, an authorised insurer, issued",audio_7_58.mp3
a policy of insurance to cover the bus without receiving the premium therefor. By reason of the provisions of Ss.  147(5) and 149(1) of the,audio_7_59.mp3
"motor vehicles act, the appellant became liable to indemnify third parties in respect of the liability which that policy covered and to satisfy awards of",audio_7_60.mp3
compensation in respect thereof notwithstanding its entitlement (upon which we do not express any opinion) to avoid or cancel the policy for the reason that,audio_7_61.mp3
"the cheque issued in payment of the premium thereon had not been honoured. Thus, the three-judge bench refrained from expressing any opinion on the question",audio_7_62.mp3
of insurers entitlement to avoid or cancel the policy as against the insured when the cheque issued for payment of the premium was dishonoured. Subsequently,audio_7_63.mp3
the same question was mooted before a two-judge bench of this court in new india assurance co. Ltd. vs.  . Rula and ors. {2000 (3),audio_7_64.mp3
scc 195} but the question of insurers right to repudiate the claim as against the insurer in a similar situation did not arise therein and,audio_7_65.mp3
hence the bench parried the question. Thus the question has now to be considered as the same is the crux of the issue involved in,audio_7_66.mp3
"this Cas. . As pointed out earlier the insurance is a contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify Anr.  against loss, damage or liability arising from an",audio_7_67.mp3
unknown or contingent event and is applicable only to some contingency or act to occur in future. We have to consider how far the legislature,audio_7_68.mp3
"has controlled the insurance business. S.  2(9) of the insurance act defines insurer, inter alia, as any body corporate carrying on the business of insurance",audio_7_69.mp3
which is a body corporate Inc.  under any law for the time being in force in india. S.  2(d) of the act says that every,audio_7_70.mp3
insurer shall be subject to all the provisions of this act in relation to any class of insurance business so long as his liabilities in,audio_7_71.mp3
india in respect of business of that class remain unsatisfied or not otherwise provided for. It is in the aforesaid context that we have to,audio_7_72.mp3
consider the impact of S.  64-vb of the insurance act. As sub-Ss.  (1) and (2) of the said S.  alone are material for the purpose,audio_7_73.mp3
we extract them herein: (1) no insurer shall assume any risk in india in respect of any insurance business on which premium is not ordinarily,audio_7_74.mp3
payable outside india unless and until the premium payable is received by him or is guaranteed to be paid by such person in such manner,audio_7_75.mp3
"and within such time as may be prescribed or unless and until deposit of such amount as may be prescribed, is made in advance in",audio_7_76.mp3
"the prescribed manner.national insurance Co.  ltd vs.  seema malhotra and ors on 20 february, 2001",audio_7_77.mp3
"Ascertained in advance, the risk may be assumed not earlier than the date on which the premium has been paid in cash or by cheque",audio_7_78.mp3
"to the insurer. Sub-S.  (1) is not applicable to cases in which premium is ordinarily payable outside india. In other words, the insurer has no",audio_7_79.mp3
liability to the insured unless and until the premium payable is received by the insurer. As the premium can be paid in cash or by,audio_7_80.mp3
"cheque, what is the position when the cheque issued to the insurer is dishonoured by the drawee bank? Ss.  51, 52 and 54 of the",audio_7_81.mp3
indian contract act can profitably be referred to for the purpose of deciding the point. They are subsumed under the sub- title performance of reciprocal,audio_7_82.mp3
promises in the said act. S.  51 deals with a contract concerning reciprocal promises to be simultaneously performed and in such a contract the promisee,audio_7_83.mp3
is absolved from performing his promise unless the promisor is ready or willing to perform his part of the promise. S.  52 says that where,audio_7_84.mp3
the order in which reciprocal promises are to be performed has not been expressly provided in the contract such promise shall be performed in that,audio_7_85.mp3
order which the nature of the transaction warrants it. Illustration (b) given to S.  52 highlights the utility of the provision. That illustration is as,audio_7_86.mp3
"follows: a and b contract that a shall make over his stock-in-trade to b at a fixed price, and b promise to give security for",audio_7_87.mp3
"the payment of the money. As promise need not be performed until the security is given, for the nature of transaction requires that a should",audio_7_88.mp3
have security before he delivers up his stock. S.  54 of the contract act is to be read in that background. It is extracted below:,audio_7_89.mp3
"when a contract consists of reciprocal promises, such that one of them cannot be performed, or that its performance cannot be claimed till the other",audio_7_90.mp3
"has been performed, and the promisor of the promise last mentioned fails to perform it, such promisor cannot claim the performance of the reciprocal promise,",audio_7_91.mp3
and must make compensation to the other party to the contract for any loss which such other party may sustain by the non-performance of the,audio_7_92.mp3
"contract. In a contract of insurance when an insurer gives a cheque towards payment of premium or part of the premium, such a contract consists",audio_7_93.mp3
"of reciprocal promise. The drawer of the cheque promises the insurer that the cheque, on presentation, would yield the amount in cash. It cannot be",audio_7_94.mp3
forgotten that a cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker. A bill of exchange is an instrument in writing containing an,audio_7_95.mp3
unconditional order directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money to a certain person. It involves a promise that such money would,audio_7_96.mp3
"be paid. Thus, when the insured fails to pay the premium promised, or when the cheque issued by him towards the premium is returned dishonoured",audio_7_97.mp3
by the bank concerned the insurer need not perform his part of the promise. The corollary is that the insured cannot claim performance from the,audio_7_98.mp3
"insurer in such a situation.national insurance Co.  ltd vs.  seema malhotra and ors on 20 february, 2001",audio_7_99.mp3
Void. S.  65 of the contract act says that when a contract becomes void any person who has received any advantage under such contract is,audio_7_100.mp3
"bound to restore it to the person from whom he received it. So, even if the insurer has disbursed the amount covered by the policy",audio_7_101.mp3
"to the insured before the cheque was returned dishonoured, insurer is entitled to get the money back. However, if the insured makes up the premium",audio_7_102.mp3
even after the cheque was dishonoured but before the date of accident it would be a different Cas.  as payment of consideration can be treated,audio_7_103.mp3
as paid in the order in which the nature of transaction required it. As such an event did not happen in this Cas.  the insurance,audio_7_104.mp3

"summarises the objective of allowing compounding of an offence under S.  138 of the ni act: ""18.2. The object of the provision being primarily compensatory,",audio_11_54.mp3
"punitive element being mainly with the object of enforcing the compensatory element, compounding at the initial stage has to be encouraged but is not debarred",audio_11_55.mp3

Babalal24 a three judge bench of this court observed that the effect of an offence under S.  138 of the ni act is Ltd.  to,audio_11_60.mp3
"two Pvt.  parties involved in a commercial transaction. However, the intent of the legislature in providing a Crl.  sanction for dishonour of cheques is to",audio_11_61.mp3
"ensure the credibility of transactions involving negotiable instruments. The court observed: ""4. It may be noted that when the offence was inserted in the statute",audio_11_62.mp3
"in 1988, it carried the provision for imprisonment up to one year, which was revised to two years following the amendment to the act in",audio_11_63.mp3
2002. It is quite evident that the legislative intent was to provide a strong Crl.  remedy in order to deter the worryingly high incidence of,audio_11_64.mp3
"dishonour of cheques. While the possibility of imprisonment up to two years provides a remedy of a punitive nature, the provision for imposing a ""fine",audio_11_65.mp3
"which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque"" serves a compensatory purpose. What must be remembered is that the dishonour of a cheque",audio_11_66.mp3
can be best described as a regulatory offence that has been created to serve the public interest in ensuring the reliability of these instruments. The,audio_11_67.mp3
"impact of this offence is usually confined to the Pvt.  parties involved in commercial transactions."" 30. However, this court also noted that the introduction of",audio_11_68.mp3

"of india, more than 38 lakh cheque bouncing cases were pending before various courts in the country as of october 2008. This is putting an",audio_11_73.mp3

resulting in ultimate closure of the Cas.  rather than continuing with a protracted litigation before the court. This is beneficial for the complainant as it,audio_11_75.mp3
"results in early recovery of money; alteration of the terms of the contract for higher compensation and avoidance of litigation. Equally, the accused is benefitted",audio_11_76.mp3
"as it leads to avoidance of a conviction and sentence or payment of a fine. It also leads to unburdening of the judicial system, which",audio_11_77.mp3
has a huge pendency of complaints filed under S.  138 of the ni act. In damodar S.  prabhu (supra) this court had emphasised that the,audio_11_78.mp3
compensatory aspect of the remedy under S.  138 of the ni act must be preferred and has encouraged litigants to resolve disputes amicably. The court,audio_11_79.mp3
"observed: ""18. It is quite obvious that with respect to the offence of dishonour of cheques, it is the compensatory aspect of the remedy which",audio_11_80.mp3

"rests upon the accused to rebut the existing presumption on the touchstone of preponderance of probability. 22. Further, the accused in a trial under S. ",audio_13_117.mp3

"presume that in the common course of natural events, the communication would have been delivered at the address of the addressee. But the presumption that",audio_13_153.mp3

"presumption, S.  27 refers to a specific presumption 14. S.  27 gives rise to a presumption that service of notice has been effected when it",audio_13_155.mp3

"31. Before noting the line of defence of the accused that can be deduced through the cross examination of the complainant witnesses, it is apposite",audio_13_165.mp3
to note the admitted facts in the present matter: (a) the accused is a partnership firm. This has been established in view of the consistent,audio_13_166.mp3
"position of cw 1 as well as cw 2. Furthermore, nowhere during the course of the trial the accused has disputed that alkarna is not",audio_13_167.mp3
"a partnership firm. Not arishi pal kharmania vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 23 on 14 july, 2023",audio_13_168.mp3
By the accused. (b) accused sandeep chaudhary is the partner and authorized signatory of accused alkarma firm. The same stands proved on a co-joint reading,audio_13_169.mp3
and perusal of the cheque in question and notice under S.  251 crpc. The accused sandeep chaudhary has admitted his signatures on the cheque in,audio_13_170.mp3
"question and perusal of the cheque reflects that the same is belong to ""alkarma"" of which sandeep chaudhary is the authorized signatory. Furthermore, it is",audio_13_171.mp3
also not the Cas.  of the accused that he is not the authorized signatory/partner of accused alkarma. (c) complainant used to work for the accused,audio_13_172.mp3
alkarma. This has also not been disputed by the accused. Not a single suggestion or question has been put by the accused which could directly,audio_13_173.mp3
or indirectly goes on to establish that it is the Cas.  of the accused that the complainant has no connection whatsoever with the accused alkarma,audio_13_174.mp3
"firm or that complainant was never an employee of the accused firm. As a matter of fact, ex cw1/k i.e., certificate of appointment and ex.cw1/l",audio_13_175.mp3
i.e. Salary slip brought on record by the complainant further cements the position that the complainant indeed was the employee of accused alkarma firm. 32.,audio_13_176.mp3
"In order to rebut the presumption existing in favor of the complainant, the accused through the cross examination and notice under S.  251 crpc attempted",audio_13_177.mp3
to create following line of defence: a) the cheque in question was never issued to the complainant. B) there never existed any settlement between him,audio_13_178.mp3
and the complainant as to the outstanding amount claimed by the complainant. C) the blank signed cheques were used to be kept in his office,audio_13_179.mp3
for daily use and the same were taken from the said office and misused. (notice under S.  251 crpc.) d) the cheque in question were,audio_13_180.mp3

"complainant. (statement under S.  313 crpc.)rishi pal kharmania vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 23 on 14 july, 2023",audio_13_184.mp3
251 crpc he only stated that blank signed cheques used to be kept in his office for daily use and the same were taken from,audio_13_185.mp3
"the said office and misused. Here, the accused never even mentioned as to who took the said cheques or when the said cheques were taken.",audio_13_186.mp3
"However, only when the complainant examined cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur, the accused in his statement under S.  313 crpc modified and changed his position",audio_13_187.mp3
and stated that the cheque in question were in possession of vijay thakur and the same have been misused by vijay thakur. 34. During the,audio_13_188.mp3
course of the trial objection was raised with respect to full and final settlement brought on record since the same was not original. The objection,audio_13_189.mp3
"was also decided in favor of the accused. However, mere absence of settlement agreement by itself does not in any manner create probable defence in",audio_13_190.mp3
"favor of the accused, viewed specifically in the light of the fact that the complainant was the employee of the accused firm and further cw1",audio_13_191.mp3
"i.e., the complainant and cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur through their testimony has been able to establish that a settlement was arrived between the accused",audio_13_192.mp3
"firm and the complainant. 35. Furthermore, the accused never initiated any complaint or legal proceedings with respect to the misuse of the cheque. As a",audio_13_193.mp3
"matter of fact, there exists a total of 5 cheques bounce cases pending between the accused and the complainant in the same court. A total",audio_13_194.mp3
of 33 cases are pending against the accused with respect to multiple cheques in the same court. It is highly unnatural and improbable that where,audio_13_195.mp3
"close to three dozen cheque bounce cases have been filed against the accused and he takes a stand that all the cheques have been misused,",audio_13_196.mp3
not a single complaint or legal proceedings or even a stop payment instruction has been initiated by the accused. This conduct of the accused further,audio_13_197.mp3
weakens his line of defence. 36. Anr.  point which is noticeable is that during the cross examination of the complainant as well as cw 2,audio_13_198.mp3
"i.e., vijay thakur, the counsel of the accused took a line of defence that the documents which has been filed on record i.e., settlement, does",audio_13_199.mp3
not bear the signature of the accused and only of vijay kumar cw 2. He has further through the cross examination of the complainant as,audio_13_200.mp3
well as his witness attempted to establish that cw 2 was never authorized by the accused to enter into any settlement with the complainant. This,audio_13_201.mp3
"line of defence also does not hold much water. It stands proved through the testimony of cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur that he was also",audio_13_202.mp3
the employee of accused firm and was working in the position of Sr.  manager. The same also stands proved through the documents which has been,audio_13_203.mp3
brought on record by cw 2 which are on the letter head of the accused firm. 37. Cw 2 further brought on record authorization letter,audio_13_204.mp3
dated 08.01.2018 ex cw2/b which does establish that he was duly authorized. Although the accused did attempt to show that since the settlement was dated,audio_13_205.mp3
"30.11.2017 and whereas the authorization letter ex cw2/b is of 08.01.2018, cw 2 was never authorized to enter into any settlement agreement on behalf of",audio_13_206.mp3
"the accused. However, a plausible explanation to this effect was given by cw 2 in his cross examination that since he was working in continuity",audio_13_207.mp3
with the accused firm he was under directions form the accused to sign mark a and mark b whereas the accused in writing had issued,audio_13_208.mp3
the Auth.  letter to him on 08.01.2018. It is proved that cw 2 has been working in the position of Sr.  manager with accusedrishi pal,audio_13_209.mp3
"kharmania vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 23 on 14 july, 2023",audio_13_210.mp3
"Further, cw 2 has been working in the accused firm since 1993. In view the abovesaid long tenure and responsible position, the delay of merely",audio_13_211.mp3
a month in the issuance of the authorization letter does not create any reasonable doubt that cw 2 was never authorized by accused sandeep chaudhary,audio_13_212.mp3
"to enter into settlement on behalf of accused firm. 38. Furthermore, a suggestion was put during the cross examination of cw 2 that ex cw2/b",audio_13_213.mp3
"i.e., the authorization letter is forged and fabricated. However, mere suggestion by itself does not prove that the document is forged and fabricated. Something more",audio_13_214.mp3
ought to be brought on record to establish the same. It is not the Cas.  of the accused that he has initiated any Crl.  proceedings,audio_13_215.mp3
with respect to the forging and fabrication of ex cw2/b. No material whatsoever has been brought on record by accused to even suggest the same.,audio_13_216.mp3
"Thus, it stands proved that cw 2 was authorized to enter into settlement agreement on behalf of accused firm with the complainant. 39. The accused",audio_13_217.mp3
had an option to examine himself as a witness which the accused opted not to avail. Where the accused does not examine himself as a,audio_13_218.mp3
"witness, his statement under S.  281 cr. P.c. Or 313 cr. P.c. Cannot be read as evidence of the accused and it has to be",audio_13_219.mp3
looked into only as an explanation of the incriminating circumstance and not as evidence. There is no presumption of law that explanation given by the,audio_13_220.mp3
"accused was truthful (v.S.  yadav vs.  reena 2010 scc online del 3294). In the present matter, in his statement under S.  313 crpc the accused",audio_13_221.mp3
stated that the documents brought by cw 2 were never authorized by him and they are forged and fabricated. If the accused wanted to prove,audio_13_222.mp3
"this, he was supposed to appear in the witness box and testify and get himself subjected to cross examination. Furthermore, nothing came in the cross",audio_13_223.mp3
examination of cw 2 so as to cast any doubt on the documents brought on record by him. 40. During the cross examination of the,audio_13_224.mp3
"complainant, a suggestion was put to the complainant that there is nothing due against the accused/firm and that the complainant has already received his entire",audio_13_225.mp3
"due from the accused when he left the firm. In other words, it is the stand of the accused that he has already paid the",audio_13_226.mp3
"entire due when the complainant left the firm and no due is left against the accused/firm. The same was, however, denied by the complainant. The",audio_13_227.mp3
abovesaid position of the accused further stands corroborated through the statement of the accused under S.  313 crpc wherein the accused stated that whatever due,audio_13_228.mp3
which he had has already been paid by him to the complainant. 41. At this juncture it is pertinent to note that in terms of,audio_13_229.mp3
"S.  1 sub-S.  (4) of payment of wages act, the act is applicable to a factory. Now, the accused firm alkarma is a factory. The",audio_13_230.mp3
"same is proved on perusal of form no 3a i.e., notice of change of manager brought on record by cw 2. 42. S.  13 a",audio_13_231.mp3
of payment of wages act is as follows: [13a. Maintenance of registers and records.--(1) every employer shall maintain such registers and records giving such particulars,audio_13_232.mp3
"of persons employed by him, the work performed by them, the wages paid to them, the deductions made from their wages, the receipts given by",audio_13_233.mp3

"(2) every register and record required to be maintained under this S.  shall, for the purposes of this act, be preserved for a period of",audio_13_236.mp3
"three years after the date of the last entry made therein.] 43. Thus, as can be seen S.  13a mandates that an employer shall maintain",audio_13_237.mp3
"registers and records of person employed by him, work performed, wages paid, deductions made, and receipts given. Alkarma being a factory was therefore required to",audio_13_238.mp3
maintain the registers as per the labor legislations. The accused brought no registers maintained by him in this regard. If the stand of the accused,audio_13_239.mp3
"is that he had already paid all the dues to the complainant, he ought to have brought the registers which were maintained by him reflecting",audio_13_240.mp3
"the same, however, the accused brought nothing on record. Thus, adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused firm and further the defence raised",audio_13_241.mp3
"by the accused regarding due payment already been made to the complainant stands rejected. 44. The present matter, as per the memo of parties has",audio_13_242.mp3
been filed against m/s alkarma through its partner sandeep chaudhary. In the complaint there exists a separate averment that accused sandeep chaudhary is partner of,audio_13_243.mp3
"m/s alkarma and was/is looking after day-to-day affairs and is the authorized signatory of the Co. . Further, accused sandeep chaudhary signed on the cheque in",audio_13_244.mp3
question as the authorized signatory of alkarma. Notice under S.  251 crpc was also framed against accused sandeep chaudhary as partner of accused alkarma. It,audio_13_245.mp3
is also not the Cas.  of the accused sandeep chaudhary that he is not the partner or authorized signatory of accused alkarma. In fact the,audio_13_246.mp3
"entire defence of accused sandeep chaudhary was raised on the premise that accused sandeep chaudhary is the partner of accused alkarma. Hence, in the present",audio_13_247.mp3

"course of cheque. When the complainant presented the cheque it impliesp.J.  jacob vs.  ullas mon on 7 march, 2020",audio_17_113.mp3
By adducing the defense evidence. So the burden is on the accused to rebut the presumption. 13. The accused has specifically deposed that the complainant,audio_17_114.mp3
"paid rs.8,32,000/- towards balance amount payable by him to the accused in respect the work done by him and not for the advance amount as",audio_17_115.mp3
"alleged by the complainant, therefore, he is not liable to pay any amount to the complainant. 14. So, it is an admitted fact of issuance",audio_17_116.mp3
of cheque by the accused. It is the main contention of the accused is that he is not due to any amount as claimed by,audio_17_117.mp3
"the complainant under ex.p1. Then, in my opinion question arises that as it is a matter of the year 2015, why the accused has not",audio_17_118.mp3
"lodged complaint against complainant for misusing of cheque by the complainant, even after receipt of demand notice, the accused has not taken any legal action",audio_17_119.mp3
against the complainant for misuse of cheque. 15. The learned counsel for the complainant has argued that the accused is a sub contractor to carry,audio_17_120.mp3

"has paid rs.8,32,000/- by way of cheque which was encashed by the accused scch-9 on 26-02-2014 . The accused did not carry out the said",audio_17_122.mp3

against him for misusing of cheque in question to file this Cas.  against him when he has not issued the cheque in question to him,audio_17_125.mp3
towards discharge of his liability. The accused admitted the fact that the above cheque belongs to his account. Hence the complainant has proved that the,audio_17_126.mp3
accused has issued the cheque towards discharge of his liability. The said cheque was presented for encashment within 3 months from the date of issue,audio_17_127.mp3
"and the said cheque was bounced as funds insufficient and the notice was issued on him but he failed to clear the cheque amount. Hence,",audio_17_128.mp3
"prayed that the accused is liable for punishment and for payment of cheque amount. Now, the question is whether ex.p1 cheque was issued towards discharge",audio_17_129.mp3
of liability. 16. The d.w.1 during the course of cross- examination admits his cheque and signature on cheque as ex.p1(a). Dw-1 admits that he is,audio_17_130.mp3

Ground and circumstances of the Cas.  from the admitted facts from the mouth of accused. As i above discussed the conduct of the parties has,audio_17_139.mp3
to be considered if really the accused has not issued the cheque for legal recoverable debt why he has not scch-9 lodged Crl.  proceedings against,audio_17_140.mp3
the complainant till today. 17. The statutory presumption under sec.139 of n.i. Act explains initial presumption infavour of the producer of an instrument. It says,audio_17_141.mp3
"court shall presume that one instrument is handed over infavour of Anr.  person only for the purpose of recover of existed debt. Therefore, the statutory",audio_17_142.mp3
"presumption explained under sec.139 of n.i. Act always provides presumption infavour of the complainant. But, it does not mean that the statutory presumption cannot be",audio_17_143.mp3

by counsel for the complainant wherein he deposed that since 2006 he was doing water proofing work and he worked with the complainant during 2008,audio_17_156.mp3
"onwards. He is having his own Co. , which is a registered proprietorship concern run under the name and style of ultra proof engineers. He is",audio_17_157.mp3
having vat registration certificate. Said Co.  is in the Aff.  address. He has demanded the complainant for return of cheques after completion of scch-9 project,audio_17_158.mp3
work by writing. He has given axis bank cheque of jalahalli branch. He is not remembering the cheque numbers. He do not know the consequences,audio_17_159.mp3
of issuing of blank cheques. He denied that he has not issued the blank signed cheques to the complainant. He denied that he issued ex.p.1,audio_17_160.mp3
towards discharge of his liability. He admits his signature but denies the contents of ex.p.1 written by him. The complainant himself used his letter head,audio_17_161.mp3
"and he himself prepared the bill. He is not having any documents to show that he worked for rs.23,32,000/-. The accused identified his letter head",audio_17_162.mp3
is marked as ex.p.9. He admits ex.p.6 but denies his signature in ex.p.6. He has no problem to send the signature found in ex.p.6 to,audio_17_163.mp3

Which came to be bounced on its presentation and he gave ex.p.1 with interest. He denied that the notice issued by the complainant has been,audio_17_165.mp3
served on him and he is deposing falsely before the court in order to escape from the liability. 21. On perusal of appreciation of the,audio_17_166.mp3
"oral testimony of the accused, it can be held that entire defense taken by the accused regarding issuance of cheque admitted. Therefore, when there is",audio_17_167.mp3
"an evidence of complainant regarding issuance of cheque scch-9 and dishonor of cheque on it's presentation, when there is no defence evidence to rebut the",audio_17_168.mp3
"presumption available u/s.118 & 139 of the act. 22. The counsel for the complainant filed written arguments and argued that, the accused received a sum",audio_17_169.mp3
"of rs.8,32,000/- from the complainant as an advance amount to start one of his work through cheque and in ex.p8 page no.4, the transaction entry",audio_17_170.mp3

did not do the work and suggested to get the work done through some other person since he is out of station. The accused issued,audio_17_172.mp3
"the cheque bearing No.  188774 for rs.9,77,000/- towards repayment of a legally enforceable debt. The accused volunteered to issue the above cheque bearing no.188774 for",audio_17_173.mp3

"26.02.2014 for rs.8,96,000/- in favour of the complainant. The accused admits the signature on ex.p1 belongs to him and the cheque belongs to his account",audio_17_175.mp3
and claims that he has handed over three blank signed cheques to the complainant before starting the work. The accused has not produced any material,audio_17_176.mp3
evidence scch-9 before this court to prove that the complainant has collected three cheques from the accused. The accused is unable to provide even the,audio_17_177.mp3
"cheque details to this court. Had he issued the said blank cheques as he claims, the cheques leaves would have been with continuous numbers? whereas",audio_17_178.mp3
the first cheque issued to the complainant is bearing No.  188754 and the second cheque is bearing no.188774 which clearly indicates that the said two,audio_17_179.mp3
cheques were not issued together for security purpose as claimed by the accused but issued on different times/occasions for the repayment of a of a,audio_17_180.mp3
legally enforceable debt. The accused further contents that the cheque leaves where collected by the complainant from the accused before giving sub-contract work to the,audio_17_181.mp3
accused which is incorrect as there was no need for collecting blank cheques from the accused while assigning the job. Hence prayed to convict the,audio_17_182.mp3
accused in accordance with law. 23. The learned counsel for the complainant has relied on the following decisions: 1. Appeal (crl.) 1015 fo 1999 in,audio_17_183.mp3

"cheque bouncing cases, the judicial scrutiny revolves around the satisfaction of ingredients enumerated under S.  138 ni act and if so, whether the accused was",audio_19_68.mp3

"act refers to a general presumption, S.  27 refers to a specific presumption 14. S.  27 gives rise to a presumption that service of notice",audio_19_118.mp3

of signature on the cheque by the accused further does not inspire much confidence as the defence raised by the accused as well as submission,audio_19_133.mp3
that has come forth in her cross examination does not create any dent in the Cas.  of the complainant. The defence raised by the accused,audio_19_134.mp3
"can be summarized as under: i. That she or her husband has never taken any amount from the complainant, ii. That she have not issued",audio_19_135.mp3

of that agreement which necessitated his wife to file a specific performance suit against the plaintiff in o.s.no:5858/2012. During the pendency of the said suit,audio_24_52.mp3

"agreement dated 12.06.2013 and also having regard to the clear admission of the plaintiff as aforesaid, the question of his paying any rent does not",audio_24_60.mp3
arise. The averments and allegations made in Para.  scch-25 no.4 of the plaint are bundle of lies and are wholly misleading. The plaintiff is trying,audio_24_61.mp3
to misrepresent facts even before this court. The plaintiff's assertion that he was representing her in o.s.2711/2010 is already negatived by the city Civ.  court,audio_24_62.mp3

uncharitable allegations. There is no true or merit in the averment made in para 5 of the plaintiff that plaintiff requires the Sch.  property for,audio_24_65.mp3
"her bonafide use and occupation. As a matter of fact she has agreed to sell the entire property, firstly in favour of his wife and",audio_24_66.mp3
"thereafter in his favour. While the first agreement is held to have been duly proved in the judgment rendered in o.s.5858/2012, the plaintiff has scch-25",audio_24_67.mp3
admitted the execution of the second agreement in the course of her evidence recorded in the said suit. He admits issuance of notice by the,audio_24_68.mp3
plaintiff on 8.11.2013 but denies the contents of said notice as the demand made in it is legally untenable and he has sent a reply,audio_24_69.mp3
on 29.10.2013. Further contends that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain this suit. On the plaintiff's own assertion the rate of rent payable by,audio_24_70.mp3
"the defendant in respect of the Sch.  property is rs.3,115/€ per month. Assuming without conceding that the said assertion is correct then the rate of",audio_24_71.mp3
"rent being below rs.3,500/€ the karnataka rent act 1999 get attracted to the Sch.  property and accordingly this suit is not maintainable. The carpet area",audio_24_72.mp3
mentioned in Para.  8 of the plaint and which is referable to the karnataka rent act is only in respect of non residential or commercial,audio_24_73.mp3

of the Sch.  property as a tenant under the rent agreement executed by smt.mudduganagamma and after her demise as the plaintiff demanded payment of rents,audio_24_177.mp3

as the plaintiff orally instructed him to not to pay rents in view of sale of agreements executed in his favour in respect of whole,audio_24_179.mp3

first agreement of sale. Admittedly the plaintiff preferred appeal on the said decree before the Hon'ble  h.c. And stay is operating but however the Hon'ble ,audio_24_189.mp3
xi addl city Civ.  court has held first sale agreement is proved and on that basis earnest money was ordered to be refunded. From this,audio_24_190.mp3
it is clear that the plaintiff executed the first agreement of sale as contended by the defendant. As per the defendant he preferred o.s.8747/2013 for,audio_24_191.mp3

"the Sch.  property also, scch-25 wherein the plaintiff asserted that she derived title of the said property through will dated 29€09€2011 from muddugangamma and she",audio_24_195.mp3

(10) it is specifically mentioned that the possession of the property will be delivered upon execution of deed of absolute sale deed. From bare perusal,audio_24_198.mp3
of ex.d.6 it is clear that there is no any specific mentioned about delivery of possession to the defendant. On the basis of ex.d.6 and,audio_24_199.mp3
execution of first agreement for sale in favor of W/O  the defendant the counsel for the defendant contends that now the defendant is not,audio_24_200.mp3
in possession of the Sch.  property as a tenant but he is in possession of the property on the basis of above two agreements in,audio_24_201.mp3
new capacity and by scch-25 executing the above said two agreements the earlier status of the defendant as tenant has been converted as a purchaser,audio_24_202.mp3
of the property and earlier status of the defendant has been ceased and hence there do not exist relationship of landlord and tenant between the,audio_24_203.mp3
plaintiff and defendant as the plaintiff has received part of the sale consideration under the agreements and the defendant got decree in o.s.no.5858/2012. On the,audio_24_204.mp3
other side the counsel for the plaintiff submits that as the plaintiff's specific Cas.  is that the defendant has created the above agreements by fraud,audio_24_205.mp3
and misrepresentation by taking signatures of the plaintiff on blank papers and blank cheque and they preferred appeal on the decree passed in o.s.no.5858/2012 and,audio_24_206.mp3
the other suit is pending for adjudication and hence as the plaintiff disputes the said agreements for sale and hence still the relationship of landlady,audio_24_207.mp3
and tenant exists. Scch-25 22. Looking to the above contention and rival contention of the parties as narrated above there is a serious dispute between,audio_24_208.mp3
the parties about the agreements for sale but this court has Ltd.  jurisdiction only to adjudicate the dispute of the parties with regard to ejectment,audio_24_209.mp3
and arrears of rent by considering whether there exists the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties and hence this court can not adjudicate,audio_24_210.mp3
"about the genuineness of the above said agreements for sale. However, the Hon'ble  city Civ.  court in o.s.no.5858/2012 has upheld the first agreement for sale",audio_24_211.mp3
executed on 19€01€2012 and decreed the suit in favor of W/O  the defendant and ordered for refund of earnest money and still the said,audio_24_212.mp3
finding is binding on the parties even though there is a stay but the said finding has not been set aside till today and still,audio_24_213.mp3
the appeal is pending. From this it can be held that the plaintiff executed the first agreement for sale dated 19€01€ scch-25 2012. Admittedly the,audio_24_214.mp3
"plaintiff is convicted in a cheque bounce Cas. , which is also under challenge in the appeal, from that also the conduct of the plaintiff can",audio_24_215.mp3
"be make out at present. Moreover, the plaintiff is suffering the above said decree against her. The pw€1 clearly admitted her signaturs on the the",audio_24_216.mp3
second agreement for sale which is as per ex.d.6. No doubt under ex.d.6 there is no specific mentioned above delivery of the possession of the,audio_24_217.mp3
property in favour of the defendant. The counsel for the defendant contends that once the parties entered into agreements for sale then the status of,audio_24_218.mp3
"the parties changes as the owner terminates the earlier agreement i.e., rent agreement then the owner/plaintiff can not agitate on the old status. Per contra",audio_24_219.mp3
the counsel for the plaintiff argues that as there was no any delivery of possession in favor of defendant and moreover the defendant is in,audio_24_220.mp3
possession of the Sch.  property under the first rental agreement executed by smt.muddugangamma and hence there is no scch-25 any changes of status of the,audio_24_221.mp3
parties and moreover the plaintiff do not admits the said sale agreements as they are created and accordingly they are under challenge.smt.dhanalakshmi vs.  sri. K.puttappa,audio_24_222.mp3

"Relied upon first decision which is mentioned above. In the said decision the Hon'ble  madras h.c. Observed that, in the said Cas.  the parties even",audio_24_224.mp3
not produced agreement of sale and in the copy of receipt also there is no any mention that the parties have agreed that the relationship,audio_24_225.mp3
of landlord and tenant should cease and the tenants possession should be traced only to the agreement of sale and hence as the said document,audio_24_226.mp3
was not produced and no such narration in the receipt about ceasing of status of the tenant and hence the Hon'ble  madras h.c. Held that,audio_24_227.mp3
the liability to pay the rent does not cease and hence the respondent therein is entitled for eviction of the tenant. In the second decision,audio_24_228.mp3
which is referred above the Hon'ble  scch-25 s.c. At para 37 observed that there is no any such Cl.  or a Cl.  akin thereto in,audio_24_229.mp3

"legal position that mere assertion by the tenant that he is in possession in part performance of an agreement of sale, or the mere filing",audio_24_232.mp3
"a suit for specific performance, by itself will not lead to deferment of the eviction proceedings under S.  43 of the new act. In the",audio_24_233.mp3
"fourth decision it is observed that agreement of sale with tenant - no right can be acquired by tenant in property, if possession traceable to",audio_24_234.mp3
"agreement, then such possession can be sustained on basis of principle of part performance. In this Cas.  the defendant has produced the ex.d.6 alongwith receipt",audio_24_235.mp3
and no doubt there is no any mention scch-25 about ceasing of status of the parties from the date of execution of ex.d.6 but the,audio_24_236.mp3
defendant in his written statement and in his evidence clearly contended that as the plaintiff orally instructed him not to pay rents and hence he,audio_24_237.mp3
"only paid two months rent after ex.d.6 and thereafter he stopped paying rents upon the instructions of plaintiff. Further, the defendant's wife got decree in",audio_24_238.mp3
"the first suit filed by her. But the plaintiff completely disputes about the execution of ex.d.6, earlier sale agreement and denies the said document and",audio_24_239.mp3
claims that she did not instruct the defendant not to pay rents as she did not execute any agreement for sale even though she suffered,audio_24_240.mp3
decree and conviction in Crl.  cheque bounce Cas. . As already discussed above the pw€1 admitted her signatures on the ex.d.6 and on perusal of ex.d.6,audio_24_241.mp3
no doubt there is no any specific mention about change in the status of the parties or ceasing of earlier status of the parties but,audio_24_242.mp3
as per the defendant upon oral instruction of scch-25 the plaintiff he stopped paying the rents. From the conduct of the defendant that she denying,audio_24_243.mp3
the very execution of the agreements for sale an adverse inference can be drawn that with implied understanding of the parties to ex.d.6 there was,audio_24_244.mp3

and circumstances of this Cas.  and the aforesaid decisions are different and hence with due respect to the said decisions this court is of the,audio_24_246.mp3
opinion that they are not applicable to the present Cas. . 24. The counsel for the defendant has relied upon the first decision of Hon'ble  madras,audio_24_247.mp3

"for eviction will not lie. But, in this Cas. , the agreement of sale was rescinded by the tenant and the tenant filed the suit for",audio_24_255.mp3

the agreement for sale which has clearly stated that if the purchaser failed to pay the defaulted installments the purchaser shall make over possession of,audio_24_261.mp3
"the land and house shown in Sch.  to the vendor which is conspicuously absent in the present agreement"". 2) in the instant Cas. , the appellant",audio_24_262.mp3
"was in possession of the suit property and the acceptance of rs.40,000/€ as earnest money by the landlord clearly shows that such acceptance was made",audio_24_263.mp3

"sum he actually acted under the agreement for sale. This acceptance was preceded by agreement of sale, changing their relationship and this was what they",audio_24_265.mp3
"had actually intended. This has been clarified in Para.  8 of the r kanthimathi (supra) which stated that: ""this decision clearly spells out that once",audio_24_266.mp3

"Relationship arises as regards the identical subject€ matter the two sets of mutually contra relationships cannot co€exist as being inconsistent and incompatible, i.e.  to",audio_24_274.mp3
"say, if the latter can come into effect only on termination of the earlier that would be deemed to have been terminated in order to",audio_24_275.mp3
"enable the latter to operate. [see: velu v lekshmi & ors., reported in air 1953 travancore€cochin 584] in the third decision of r.kanthimathi it is",audio_24_276.mp3
"observed at para 6 to 8 as under; ""6. Any jural relationship between two persons could be created through agreement and similarly could be changed",audio_24_277.mp3
through agreement subject to the limitations under the law. Earlier when appellants were inducted into tenancy it only means both agreed that their relations is,audio_24_278.mp3
to be that of a landlord and tenant. Later when landlord decides to sell this property to the tenant and tenant agreed by entering into,audio_24_279.mp3
agreement they by their positive act changed their relationship as purchaser and seller. When seller€landlord accepts sum he actually acts under this agreement. This acceptance,audio_24_280.mp3
preceded by agreement of sale changes their relationship. This is how they intended. Once accepting such a change then their relationship of landlord tenant ceases.,audio_24_281.mp3
Scch-25 7. This court in arjunlal bhatt mall gothani v.girish chandra dutta held as under: the appellants were tenants in the premises of the respondent€landlord,audio_24_282.mp3
"and three suits, including an eviction suit, were pending against them. By an agreement between the appellants and the respondent, the respondent agreed to sell",audio_24_283.mp3
the whole property to the appellants for a certain sum to be paid to him by equal instalments. Cl.  5 of the agreement provided that,audio_24_284.mp3
"in Cas.  of default of any instalment, the agreement for sale would stand cancelled and if the purchasers failed to pay the defaulted instalments within",audio_24_285.mp3
one month's notice the payments made would stand forfeited and purchasers would make over possession of the property to the vendor. Xxx xxx under Cl. ,audio_24_286.mp3
(5) of the agreement the question of giving notice arises only if the vendor wanted to forfeit the instalments paid by the purchaser. Not even,audio_24_287.mp3
one instalment having been paid the question of forfeiture does arise and no notice was necessary for cancelling agreement. It stood automatically cancelled. It was,audio_24_288.mp3
sought to be argued before us that once the agreement stood cancelled the appellants stood restored to their original position as tenants and the suit,audio_24_289.mp3
"could not be filed without giving notice under the transfer of property act. We are of opinion that when the agreement, d/ june 7, 1959",audio_24_290.mp3
was entered into the old relationship of landlord and tenant came to an end. The rights and liabilities of the parties have to be worked,audio_24_291.mp3
out on the basis of that agreement. This decision clearly spells out that once there is agreement of sale between a land lord and a,audio_24_292.mp3
"tenant, the old relationship as such comes to an end. It goes on to record that even after the scch-25 cancellation ofsmt.dhanalakshmi vs.  sri. K.puttappa",audio_24_293.mp3
"on 28 february, 2023",audio_24_294.mp3
The date of execution of the aforesaid agreement of sale their status as that of landlord and tenant changed into a new status as that,audio_24_295.mp3
"of a purchaser and a seller. 8. Thus within this legal premises, the submission by learned counsel for (he respondent of revival of their old",audio_24_296.mp3
"relationship of landlord and tenant when she repudiates this agreement by sending back to the tenant Rs.  20,000/€ through a cheque, (which according to the",audio_24_297.mp3
appellant was not encashed) cannot be accepted. So we have no hesitation to reject the same. Every conduct of the landlady right from the date,audio_24_298.mp3
"of entering into agreement of sale, accepting money towards the sale consideration, delivering possession in lieu of such agreement all clearly indicates and has to",audio_24_299.mp3
be construed in law that she repudiated her old relationship of landlord and tenant. Thus after this parties enter into new cloak of seller and,audio_24_300.mp3
purchaser and their relationship to be governed under the said terms of the agreement. Every right and obligation thereafter would flow from it. Even if,audio_24_301.mp3
parties under the agreement of sale does not perform their obligations remedy may be availed in law as permissible under the law. Hence we have,audio_24_302.mp3
no hesitation to hold that courts below including HC  committed error in holding that tenant committed wilful default. When appellant is no more tenant,audio_24_303.mp3
"how can non€payment be construed as wilful default"". Further, it is also important to refer S.  53€a which reads thus; scch-25 S.  53a. Part performance",audio_24_304.mp3
- where any person contract to transfer for consideration any immovable property by writing signed by him or on his behalf from which the terms,audio_24_305.mp3
"necessary to constitute the transfer can be ascertained with reasonable certainty, and the transferee has, in part performance of the contract, taken possession of the",audio_24_306.mp3
"property or any part thereof, or the transferee, being already in possession, continues in possession in part performance of the contract and has done some",audio_24_307.mp3

"one but the said fact cannot be appreciated by this court in this Cas.  having Ltd.  jurisdiction. Therefore, on careful perusal of the above decisions",audio_24_310.mp3
they are aptly applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present Cas.  to hold that after execution of sale agreements there do not exists,audio_24_311.mp3
"relationship of landlord and tenant between the plaintiff and defendant herein. Scch-25 25. Therefore, on over all assessment of the entire evidence on record and",audio_24_312.mp3
by applying the ratio held in the above decisions relied upon by the counsel for the defendant it is clear that after execution of sale,audio_24_313.mp3
agreements by plaintiff and receipt of earnest money under them the earlier status of the plaintiff and defendant came to an end and there do,audio_24_314.mp3

"payee from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. (para 26, n. Harihara krishnan vs.  j. Thomas, (2018) 13 scc 663, referred",audio_26_111.mp3

"holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in S.  138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any",audio_26_114.mp3
"debt or other liability."" 15. Thus, in cheque bouncing cases, the judicial scrutiny revolves around the satisfaction of ingredients enumerated under S.  138 ni act",audio_26_115.mp3
"and if so, whether the accused was able to rebut the statutory presumption contemplated by S.  139 ni act. S.  139 is an example of",audio_26_116.mp3
"reverse onus Cl.  which usually imposes an evidentiary burden and not a persuasive burden. In other words, evidence of a character, not to prove a",audio_26_117.mp3
"fact affirmatively, but to lead evidence to show non-existence of a liability. Further the law is well settled that when an accused has to rebut",audio_26_118.mp3
"the presumption under S.  139, the standard of proof of doing so is that of ""preponderance of probability"" (rangappa vs.  sri mohan (2010) 11 scc",audio_26_119.mp3
"441). Once execution of cheque is admitted, it is a legal presumption under S.  139 of negotiable instrument act, the cheque was issued for discharging",audio_26_120.mp3
legally enforceable debt. 16. Attention is also invited to S.  118(a) wherein a presumption of the cheque having been issued in discharge of a legally,audio_26_121.mp3
"sustainable liability and drawn for good consideration, arises. S.  118 of the n.i act provides:- ""presumptions as to negotiable instruments: until the contrary is proved,",audio_26_122.mp3

"when it has been accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for consideration;"" 17. Hence, it can be seen that from",audio_26_124.mp3
its very inception a presumption that the cheque was issued in discharge of a debt or other liability subsists in favour of the complainant and,audio_26_125.mp3
"onus rests upon thedharambir vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 25 may, 2023",audio_26_126.mp3
"18. Further, the accused in a trial under S.  138 has two options. He can either show that consideration and debt did not exist or",audio_26_127.mp3
that under the particular circumstances of the Cas.  the non-existence of consideration and debt is so probable that a prudent man ought to suppose that,audio_26_128.mp3
"no consideration and debt existed (para 20, kumar exports vs.  sharma carpets (2009) 2 scc 513). The accused can also show that he has already",audio_26_129.mp3
"returned the amount taken by him. Analysis & conclusion 19. Now, the law is also well settled that ""once the cheque relates to the account",audio_26_130.mp3

"enjoins on the court to presume that the holder of the cheque received it for the discharge of any debt or liability."" 20. In this",audio_26_136.mp3
"matter, the accused has admitted his signature. Therefore, the presumption under S.  139 ni act does get raised in favor of the complainant and against",audio_26_137.mp3
"the accused. Thus, the accused now has to rebut the presumption on the touchstone of preponderance of probabilities. Further, the accused has not lead his",audio_26_138.mp3
"defence evidence. However, the law is also well settled that the accused in order to rebut the presumption need not to step into the witness",audio_26_139.mp3

"the accused is a partnership firm. This has been established in view of the consistent position of cw 1 as well as cw 2. Furthermore,",audio_26_175.mp3
nowhere during the course of the trial the accused has disputed that alkarna is not a partnership firm. Not a single suggestion disputing alkarma not,audio_26_176.mp3
being a partnership firm has been put forth by the accused. Ii) accused sandeep chaudhary is the partner and authorized signatory of accused alkarma firm.,audio_26_177.mp3
The same stands proved on a co-joint reading and perusal of the cheque in question and notice under S.  251 crpc. The accused sandeep chaudhary,audio_26_178.mp3
"has admitted his signatures on the cheque in question and perusal of the cheque reflects that the same is belong to ""alkarma"" of which sandeep",audio_26_179.mp3
"chaudhary is the authorized signatory. Furthermore, it is also not the Cas.  of the accused that he is not the authorized signatory/partner of accused alkarma.",audio_26_180.mp3
Iii) complainant used to work for the accused alkarma. This has also not been disputed by the accused. Not a single suggestion or question has,audio_26_181.mp3
been put by the accused which could directly or indirectly goes on to establish that it is the Cas.  of the accused that the complainant,audio_26_182.mp3
"has no connection whatsoever with the accused alkarma firm or that complainant was never an employee of the accused firm. As a matter of fact,",audio_26_183.mp3
"ex cw1/j i.e., proof of appointment and ex cw1/k i.e., proof of salary brought on record by the complaint further cements the position that the",audio_26_184.mp3
"complainant indeed was the employee of accused alkarma firm. 28. In order to rebut the presumption existing in favor of the complainant, the accused through",audio_26_185.mp3
the cross examination and notice under S.  251 crpc attempted to create following line of defence: i)) the cheque in question was never issued to,audio_26_186.mp3
the complainant. Ii) there never existed any settlement between him and the complainant as to the outstanding amount claimed by the complainant. Iii) the blank,audio_26_187.mp3
signed cheques were used to be kept in his office for daily use and the same were taken from the said office and misused. (notice,audio_26_188.mp3
"under S.  251 crpc.)dharambir vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 25 may, 2023",audio_26_189.mp3
Been misused by vijay thakur and never gave authorization to anyone regarding the issuance of cheque in question. (statement under S.  313 crpc.) v) whatever,audio_26_190.mp3
documents that have been brought on record by the complainant and his witness are forged and fabricated and were never created by him. Vi) whatever,audio_26_191.mp3
"due, if any, is there against him has already been paid by him to the complainant. (statement under S.  313 crpc.) 29. The line of",audio_26_192.mp3
defence raised by the accused appears to be incredible. In his notice under S.  251 crpc he only stated that blank signed cheques used to,audio_26_193.mp3
"be kept in his office for daily use and the same were taken from the said office and misused. Here, the accused never even mentioned",audio_26_194.mp3
"as to who took the said cheques or when the said cheques were taken. However, only when the complainant examined cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur,",audio_26_195.mp3
the accused in his statement under S.  313 crpc modified and changed his position and stated that the cheque in question were in possession of,audio_26_196.mp3
vijay thakur and the same have been misused by vijay thakur. 30. During the course of the trial objection was raised with respect to full,audio_26_197.mp3
"and final settlement brought on record since the same was not original. The objection was also decided in favor of the accused. However, mere absence",audio_26_198.mp3
"of settlement agreement by itself does not in any manner create probable defence in favor of the accused, viewed specifically in the light of the",audio_26_199.mp3
"fact that the complainant was the employee of the accused firm and further cw1 i.e., the complainant and cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur through their",audio_26_200.mp3
"testimony has been able to establish that a settlement was arrived between the accused firm and the complainant. 31. Furthermore, the accused never initiated any",audio_26_201.mp3
"complaint or legal proceedings with respect to the misuse of the cheque. As a matter of fact, there exists a total of 5 cheques bounce",audio_26_202.mp3
cases pending between the accused and the complainant in the same court. A total of 33 cases are pending against the accused with respect to,audio_26_203.mp3
multiple cheques in the same court. It is highly unnatural and improbable that where close to three dozen cheque bounce cases have been filed against,audio_26_204.mp3
"the accused and he takes a stand that all the cheques have been misused, not a single complaint or legal proceedings or even a stop",audio_26_205.mp3
payment instruction has been initiated by the accused. This conduct of the accused further weakens his line of defence. 32. Anr.  point which is noticeable,audio_26_206.mp3
"is that during the cross examination of the complainant as well as cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur, the counsel of the accused took a line",audio_26_207.mp3
"of defence that the documents which has been filed on record i.e., settlement, does not bear the signature of the accused and only of vijay",audio_26_208.mp3
kumar cw 2. He has further through the cross examination of the complainant as well as his witness attempted to establish that cw 2 was,audio_26_209.mp3
never authorized by the accused to enter into any settlement with the complainant. This line of defence also does not hold much water. It stands,audio_26_210.mp3
"proved through the testimony of cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur that he was also the employee of accused firm and was working in the position",audio_26_211.mp3
of Sr.  manager. The same also stands proved through the documents which has been brought on record by cw 2 which are on the letter,audio_26_212.mp3
"head of the accuseddharambir vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 25 may, 2023",audio_26_213.mp3
33. Cw 2 further brought on record authorization letter dated 08.01.2018 ex cw2/b which does establish that he was duly authorized. Although the accused did,audio_26_214.mp3
"attempt to show that since the settlement was dated 30.11.2017 and whereas the authorization letter ex cw2/b is of 08.01.2017, cw 2 was never authorized",audio_26_215.mp3
"to enter into any settlement agreement on behalf of the accused. However, a plausible explanation to this effect was given by cw 2 in his",audio_26_216.mp3
cross examination that since he was working in continuity with the accused firm he was under directions form the accused to sign mark a and,audio_26_217.mp3
mark b whereas the accused in writing had issued the Auth.  letter to him on 08.01.2018. It is proved that cw 2 has been working,audio_26_218.mp3
"in the position of Sr.  manager with accused alkarma and was also authorized to issue identity cards to the employees of the accused alkarma. Further,",audio_26_219.mp3
"cw 2 has been working in the accused firm since 1993. In view the abovesaid long tenure and responsible position, the delay of merely a",audio_26_220.mp3
month in the issuance of the authorization letter does not create any reasonable doubt that cw 2 was never authorized by accused sandeep chaudhary to,audio_26_221.mp3
"enter into settlement on behalf of accused firm. 34. Furthermore, a suggestion was put during the cross examination of cw 2 that ex cw2/b i.e.,",audio_26_222.mp3
"the authorization letter is forged and fabricated. However, mere suggestion by itself does not prove that the document is forged and fabricated. Something more ought",audio_26_223.mp3
to be brought on record to establish the same. It is not the Cas.  of the accused that he has initiated any Crl.  proceedings with,audio_26_224.mp3
"respect to the forging and fabrication of ex cw2/b. No material whatsoever has been brought on record by accused to even suggest the same. Thus,",audio_26_225.mp3
it stands proved that cw 2 was authorized to enter into settlement agreement on behalf of accused firm with the complainant. 35. The accused had,audio_26_226.mp3
"an option to examine himself as a witness which the accused opted not to avail. Where the accused does not examine himself as a witness,",audio_26_227.mp3
his statement under S.  281 cr. P.c. Or 313 cr. P.c. Cannot be read as evidence of the accused and it has to be looked,audio_26_228.mp3

in six months time. After six months accused started avoiding complainant and started shifting his residence from one place to Anr. . It is further averred,audio_29_42.mp3
"that a compromise in writing was executed between complainant and accused in the presence of witnesses wherein accused acknowledged the loan liability of rs.1,25,000/- and",audio_29_43.mp3

"vague averment regarding friendly loan has been made. It is submitted that complaint mentions this loan amount as rs.1,25,000/- but then in the year 2005",audio_29_57.mp3
complainant had lodged an FIR  concerning an incident which involved S/O  accused and in that FIR  the loan amount was,audio_29_58.mp3

were drawn under the pressure of police should be considered probable and consequently onus shifted upon complainant to prove the transaction of loan which complainant,audio_29_63.mp3

prove the existence of debt or a liability and on that point counsel relied upon a judgement given by allahabad HC  in a Cas. ,audio_29_72.mp3
padam gupta vs.  state of up and anr. 2014 (1) jcc 26. It is contended as held in the said judgement that S.  138 negotiable,audio_29_73.mp3
"instrument act presupposes existence of legally enforceable debt or liability and in the absence of that ingredient of offence, charge will not prove. Reliance is",audio_29_74.mp3
also placed upon delhi HC  judgement reported as geeta srivastava vs.  bhanu sharma 2003 cri. L. J 801 and finally a SC  judgements,audio_29_75.mp3
"is referred on the point reported as lalit kumar sharma vs.  state of up, supreme laws today 2008 (v). 7. Before adverting to the facts",audio_29_76.mp3
"of present Cas. , as a legal proposition discussed in above referred judgements in the facts of those particular cases, i find these judgements are not",audio_29_77.mp3
attracted and applicable to the facts of the present Cas. . In the judgement given by allahabad HC  cheque had been issued towards compensation for,audio_29_78.mp3
loss sustained by complainant on account of destruction of his rented shop by national highway Auth. . Revisionist did not owe any liability towards complainant and,audio_29_79.mp3
in those circumstances it was found that prosecution of revisionist for offence under S.  138 negotiable instrument act was misfounded. In the delhi HC ,audio_29_80.mp3
"judgement, petitioner geeta srivastava had accompanied her husband at the time of alleged transaction of loan. Her husband had drawn cheque towards repayment of loan",audio_29_81.mp3
and the cheque bounced. In those circumstances it was held that petitioner merely having accompanied her husband at the time of transaction of loan would,audio_29_82.mp3
"not has saddle her with a liability for dishonour of cheque with the help of S.  141 n. I act. Accordingly, this judgement is entirely",audio_29_83.mp3
distinguishable and not at all applicable in the present Cas.  when in this Cas.  we are dealing with the proposition that accused-appellant had drawn cheque,audio_29_84.mp3
though as per appellant's plea towards discharge of loan liability of his wife. Likewise SC  judgement is also not applicable in the present Cas. ,audio_29_85.mp3
"fact situation. In that Cas.  of lalit kumar sharma, drawer of the cheque viz.  ashish narula and manish arora had been held guilty, convicted and",audio_29_86.mp3
sentenced. Anr.  cheque stated to have been drawn by manish arora in terms of settlement between parties concerning dispute which was subject matter of the,audio_29_87.mp3
"cheque wherein ashish narula and manish arora had been convicted, it was held that cheque drawn by manish arora was not to be said to",audio_29_88.mp3
have been issued in discharge of legally enforceable debt or liability. 8. Ld. Counsel stressed point that where complainant's Cas.  was contradictory as regards the,audio_29_89.mp3
amount of friendly loan and complainant's stand was further contradictory if loan was given to accused or to his wife then existence of debt or,audio_29_90.mp3
"liability cannot be held duly proved. Having considered contentions of ld. Counsel, i find it without merits. Ld. Mm found that transaction of friendly loan",audio_29_91.mp3
stood duly proved. I do not find any illegality in the said findings arrived by the ld. Mm on the basis of evidence. Complainant sarvesh,audio_29_92.mp3
chand sood in the cross examination when asked about the loan stated that accused as well his wife came to his house for taking that,audio_29_93.mp3
friendly loan. Complainant then admits in his cross examination that he had not filed any Cas.  against W/O  accused for recovery of the loan,audio_29_94.mp3
amount and then suggestion is given that infact no such loan was given to her and complainant denied the suggestion. Finally in the concluding lines,audio_29_95.mp3
of cross examination of complainant a suggestion is put and complainant denied it that the cheque in question was given asbalram verma S/O  late,audio_29_96.mp3
"sh. J. S.  verma vs.  state of up and anr. 2014 (1) jcc 26. It is on 29 may, 2014",audio_29_97.mp3
"Gokalpuri. Complainant was also confronted with certain receipts like ex.cw1/d6 and d7 and by these receipts a small amount like rs.1,000/- or rs.2,000/- was shown",audio_29_98.mp3
to have been given to the complainant or his wife by accused or his wife but then no further question was put as to in,audio_29_99.mp3
"what context those small payments were made. Finally as regards the cheques issued by accused and given to complainant in the police station, complainant admitted",audio_29_100.mp3
"in cross- examination that cheques were handed over to him in the police station and only accused, complainant and one police official raj kumar were",audio_29_101.mp3
"present. To a further question in cross examination, complainant replied that accused had come to his house two or three days before to inform the",audio_29_102.mp3
complainant that he would reach police station to hand over the cheque in question. Said statement in cross-examination conveys if accused himself wanted to deliver,audio_29_103.mp3
cheques to the complainant in the police station and accordingly complainant reached police station. Complainant relied upon a document which was a photocopy mark a,audio_29_104.mp3
"but then when accused admitted its contents and his signatures on it, it was given Exh.  mark dw1/da. In this document complainant specifically acknowledged a",audio_29_105.mp3
"liability of loan of rs.1,40,000/- and promised to repay that mount by every month installment in the sum of rs.1,000/- and with that settlement-compromise complainant",audio_29_106.mp3
agreed to withdraw his Crl.  Cas.  FIR  no.547/05. Accused as dw1 stated in cross-examination that said document was bearing his signatures and he,audio_29_107.mp3
"further admitted that he had undertaken to pay rs.1,25,000/- allegedly taken by his wife. With this kind of evidence ld. Mm relied upon SC ",audio_29_108.mp3
judgement in icds ltd. vs.  basha sabir 2002(4) crime 75 and found that if accused had issued and drawn cheques for discharge of a loan,audio_29_109.mp3
liability of his wife then he was liable to be prosecuted when cheque had bounced and he was not entitled to escape liability on a,audio_29_110.mp3
plea that liability of loan was of his wife. As regards plea of accused that cheques were drawn under the pressure of police. Ld. Mm,audio_29_111.mp3
found that there was no any other material on record to believe and accept the defence. Only by the reason or fact that cheques were,audio_29_112.mp3
"given to the complainant in the police station, it would not prove that it was given under police pressure. As discussed above when complainant was",audio_29_113.mp3
put a question in cross-examination that accused himself came to the complainant and asked / suggested to complainant to come to the police station and,audio_29_114.mp3
"accordingly complainant went to the police station where cheques were delivered, there is no other evidence or material to suggest if cheques were given by",audio_29_115.mp3
"accused under any pressure. Even if it was found that cheques were given by complainant under pressure, if it is found duly proved that cheques",audio_29_116.mp3
were drawn towards discharge of a liability then accused has to face penal consequences of its bouncing. 9. Appellant's counsel argued that where transaction of,audio_29_117.mp3
"loan was in january, 2004 and cheque had been drawn somewhere in the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008 then cheques could not be",audio_29_118.mp3
said to be in discharge of a legally enforceable liability. The alleged loan liability became a bad debt as barred by limitation. Ld. Mm has,audio_29_119.mp3
"dealt with this point in para 10 of the judgement and held that with the execution of compromise that accused had exhibited as ex.dw1/da, accused",audio_29_120.mp3
"acknowledged the liability of loan and it provided a fresh period of limitation and since this loan acknowledgement document was executed in july, 2006 the",audio_29_121.mp3
cheques were not to be said to be in discharge of time barred debt or liability. There appears no illegality in these findings. 10. Counsel,audio_29_122.mp3
"for the appellant relied upon kerala HC  judgement reported as joseph vs.  . Devassia, 2011 (3) crimes 229 and argued that where the debt",audio_29_123.mp3
had gone time barred then chequebalram verma S/O  late sh. J. S.  verma vs.  state of up and anr. 2014 (1) jcc 26. It,audio_29_124.mp3
"is on 29 may, 2014",audio_29_125.mp3
"For prosecution as the cheque could not be said to have been issued in discharge of legally enforceable debt. Having gone through this judgement, it",audio_29_126.mp3
"is found distinguishable on facts. In concluding part of the judgement, it has been specifically observed that since there was no acknowledgement of debt before",audio_29_127.mp3
"expiry of three years from the date of loan, the debt was not legally enforceable at the time of issuance of cheque. In the present",audio_29_128.mp3
"Cas. , as seen above, accused appellant acknowledged the debt in 2006 vide documents ex.pw1/da. 11. Counsel argued that statutory legal notice had not been served",audio_29_129.mp3
"upon accused. Admittedly, the notice had been sent on the office address of accused. Ld. Mm dealt with this issue in para 12 to 14",audio_29_130.mp3
of his judgement and in that regard ld. Counsel referred to testimony of defence witness dw3 wherein witness said in cross examination that even if,audio_29_131.mp3
"for sometime when accused was under suspension, all his post and other relevant ""dak"" would be sent to his residential address through peon by personal",audio_29_132.mp3
delivery or by post. Witness further admitted that any other post addressed to accused in Cas.  received by the Dept.  was sent to accused by,audio_29_133.mp3
said mode. Ld. Mm found that address mentioned on the registered post envelope as well in upc on accused was his correct address where he,audio_29_134.mp3
"was posted and working and thus as per S.  27 of general clauses act, it was deemed to have been duly served. Ld. Counsel referred",audio_29_135.mp3
to cross examination of complainant when the registered envelope on the judicial file was found containing no copy of the notice but it was an,audio_29_136.mp3
empty one. Ld. Complainant's counsel to my view rightly argued that envelope in question had been filed when complaint was filed in the year 2005,audio_29_137.mp3
"and complainant was cross examined in may, 2012 then how come complainant could be answerable if copy of notice was not in the registered envelope.",audio_29_138.mp3
No such point was ever raised at any point of time and it is none of the appellant's plea that on his first appearance in,audio_29_139.mp3
court he was prepared to pay cheque amount if statutory notice had not been received by him. I do not find any illegality in the,audio_29_140.mp3
findings arrived by the ld. Mm on this point. 12. Accordingly i find conviction judgement recorded by ld. Mm in each complaint Cas.  is based,audio_29_141.mp3
upon legal appreciation and analyses of facts as well law and it suffers no illegality. Appeal is without merits as regard conviction. Let it now,audio_29_142.mp3

through the present appeal is thus to the effect that the respondent had executed a credit facility Appl.  along with the terms and conditions of,audio_31_18.mp3
the loan; a deed of hypothecation and an irrevocable power of attorney on 22.12.2014 in favour of the appellant bank and had undertaken to repay,audio_31_19.mp3

of hypothecation the vehicle financed to be hypothecated in the name of the appellant bank can be taken over by the bank in the event,audio_31_24.mp3
of default by the respondent being the rightful owner of the same. 6. It has also been submitted by the appellant that as per the,audio_31_25.mp3
irrevocable power of attorney also the appellant had been authorized to take over the possession to sell the vehicle to appropriate the dues in the,audio_31_26.mp3
event of default of payment by the respondent. Inter alia the appellant has submitted that despite the respondent having been informed to make the payment,audio_31_27.mp3
"of the outstanding amount and also to hand over the peaceful possession of the vehicle, the respondent did not do so and thus had no",audio_31_28.mp3

the complainant has proved that the accused has issued ex.p-1 cheque in his favour towards discharge of legally recoverable debt without maintaining sufficient balance in,audio_32_32.mp3
his bank account and has failed to pay the cheque amount within time inspite of deemed service of demand notice? 2. What order? 7. My,audio_32_33.mp3
findings are: point no.1 : in affirmative. Point no.2 : as per final order. Reasons 8. Point no.1: the complainant has relied upon oral evidence,audio_32_34.mp3
of pw-1 and documentary evidence at ex.p-1 to 7 to prove his Cas. . The accused has placed reliance upon his own oral evidence and that,audio_32_35.mp3

"facts of the Cas.  are that the complainant is a co-operative society of which the accused and dw-3 are members, that the accused and dw-3",audio_32_37.mp3

"has placed reliance upon his own oral ... On 1 january, 2016",audio_32_45.mp3
Copy of gpa and letter of sbm which are marked as ex.p-1 to 7. The accused has contended that there is no seal on the,audio_32_46.mp3
cheque and memo and there is no signature on the memo as such the cheque was not presented for encashment and memo is got created,audio_32_47.mp3
"for this Cas. . In that regard, the accused has examined dw-4: srinivasa who has supported the contention of the accused. Then, the complainant has examined",audio_32_48.mp3
pw-2:nataraj who has deposed regarding dishonour of cheque at ex.p-1 and stated that the cheque was dishonoured for insufficient funds in the account of the,audio_32_49.mp3
accused. He has produced letter regarding dishonour of cheque for insufficient funds which is marked as ex.p-7. On perusal of oral evidence of pw-2 and,audio_32_50.mp3
"dw-4, it reveals that evidence of both of them is true in their respective capacity. The cheque at ex.p-1 was not presented to the branch",audio_32_51.mp3
"for encashment in which dw-4 is working and the account of the accused is not debited with cheque bounce charges, but that itself does not",audio_32_52.mp3
"make the evidence of pw-2 unbelievable. When there is a clearing house, the cheques will not be presented to concerned branch for encashment. The clearing",audio_32_53.mp3
"cell is able to see the balance in the account of customer and issue memo. In such event, the branch will have no document or",audio_32_54.mp3
"material to say that the cheque was in fact presented for encashment. i.e.  what dw-4 has deposed. But, the clearing cell is competent to",audio_32_55.mp3
depose in that regard. There is nothing on record to believe that pw-2 is deposing falsely to help the complainant. There is no nexus between,audio_32_56.mp3
"the him and the complainant to do so. Hence, i am of the opinion that evidence of pw-2 is trustworthy. Ex.p-2 is not issued by",audio_32_57.mp3
"clearing cell, but it was issued by apex co-op. Bank ltd., (axb) based on the memo issued by the clearing cell. Ex.p-7 confirms the presentation",audio_32_58.mp3
of cheque and its dishonour for insufficient funds. Evidence of pw-2 and contents of ex.p-7 are sufficient to believe that the cheque at ex.p-1 was,audio_32_59.mp3
presented for encashment on 2.4.2013 and it came to be dishonoured for insufficient funds on 3.4.2013. Exd-1 and 2 are statements pertaining to the bank,audio_32_60.mp3
account of the accused which confirm that there was no balance in his account to honour the cheque at ex.p-1 on its date and on,audio_32_61.mp3
"the date of its presentation for encashment. Merely on the basis of the fact that cheque bounce charges were not debited to the account, we",audio_32_62.mp3
can not conclude that the cheque was not at all presented for encashment and ex.p-2 and 7 are created for this Cas. . There is no,audio_32_63.mp3
logic behind the argument of the defence in that regard. There was no necessity for the payee to create the bank memo which can be,audio_32_64.mp3
"obtained by mere presentation of cheque for encashment. Hence, i reject the argument of the counsel for the accused regarding non-presentation of cheque to bank.",audio_32_65.mp3
"12. The accused has denied the Auth.  of pw-1 to file complaint and to depose regarding the matter. Except bare denials, nothing is elicited from",audio_32_66.mp3
pw-1 in that regard. Ex.p-6 is copy of gpa which authorizes pw-1 to file complaint and to give evidence in the matter. The accused is,audio_32_67.mp3
"not competent to deny the contents of ex.p-6 and the Auth.  given to pw-1 by the president of the complainant. Moreover, the evidence of dw-1",audio_32_68.mp3
"to 3 makes it clear that pw-1 has got personal knowledge about the facts of the Cas. . Hence, i am of the opinion that evidence",audio_32_69.mp3
"of pw-1 is admissible and believable. 13. Pw-1 is cross examined minutely in respect of loan transaction between the complainant and the accused. However, it",audio_32_70.mp3
"is admitted impliedly by way of suggestions and expressly by dw-1 to 3 that the accused has borrowed a loan of rs.25,000/- from the complainant",audio_32_71.mp3
"in the year 2002. The said fact is admitted by the accused during his statement. When such being the Cas. , minute particulars of loan, documents",audio_32_72.mp3

"his own oral ... On 1 january, 2016",audio_32_74.mp3
His defence. 14. The counsel for the accused has argued that the loan is of the year 2002. The last admitted payment was on 28.3.2006.,audio_32_75.mp3
"The outstanding amount if any in the account of the accused had become time barred on 28.3.2009. Whatever may be the amount, it was not",audio_32_76.mp3
"a legally enforceable debt or liability on the date of cheque and hence, dishonour of ex.p-1 cheque does not attract offence u/s 138 of the",audio_32_77.mp3
"act. But, it is to be noted that cheque is a negotiable instrument. Issuance of cheque itself is a promise to pay the amount including",audio_32_78.mp3
"a time barred debt. Hence, argument of the counsel for the accused in that regard holds no water. 15. Dw-4:srinivasa has deposed that the account",audio_32_79.mp3
of the accused pertaining to ex.p-1 was opened prior to 2003 and the cheque in question was from the cheque book issued to the accused,audio_32_80.mp3
"prior to 2003, that no cheque book is issued to him after 2005, that account No.  is changed after 2005 in which year the bank",audio_32_81.mp3
"is computerized. Dw-1: anand has stated that the complainant got his account opened in sbm, whitefield branch and obtained 10 blank signed cheque from him",audio_32_82.mp3
"as security for the loan, that one cheque is misused and other 9 cheques are still lying with the complainant. Pw-1 was cross examined at",audio_32_83.mp3
"length in that regard, but nothing is extract from him regarding obtaining of 10 blank signed cheques from the accused as security and availability of",audio_32_84.mp3
other 9 cheques with the complainant. The counsel for the accused has argued that the cheque at ex.p-1 is of the year 2002 which was,audio_32_85.mp3
"obtained as security with other 9 cheques, that the cheque is misused for filing this false Cas.  against the accused, that the cheque contains two",audio_32_86.mp3
different handwritings and two different colour ink which indicate the misuse of cheque. It is to be noted that there is no doubt that the,audio_32_87.mp3
"cheque is of year 2002 or 2003, but that itself is no ground to believe that the complainant has obtained 10 blank signed cheques from",audio_32_88.mp3
"the accused as security and one of them is misused to file this complaint. A customer of bank after getting the cheque book, can use",audio_32_89.mp3
the cheques in it at any time during continuation of the account. Neither the creditor nor the bank has any control over the issuance of,audio_32_90.mp3
cheque by the drawer. The cheque at ex.p-1 is not dishonoured on the ground that it is an old cheque. There will be no occasion,audio_32_91.mp3
for the payee to know about the date of issuance of cheque book by the bank to the drawer. There cannot be any chance of,audio_32_92.mp3
knowing that it was an old cheque. There is no corroboration to the evidence of dw-1 that the complainant has got his account opened and,audio_32_93.mp3
"obtained 10 blank signed cheque as security. There was no necessity for getting 10 blank cheques as security for a loan of rs.25,000/-. It is",audio_32_94.mp3
"pointed out that ex.p-1 is the first cheque in the series, but that itself does not prove the contention of the accused that other 9",audio_32_95.mp3
"cheques are with the complainant. Hence, argument of the counsel for the accused in that regard is liable to be rejected. 16. Ex.p-1 is the",audio_32_96.mp3
cheque dt.30.3.2013. The contention of the accused that the cheque was issued in blank as security in the year 2002 is against the legal presumption,audio_32_97.mp3
u/s 118 of the act which mandates the court to believe that the cheque is issued on the date which is mentioned in the cheque.,audio_32_98.mp3
There is no cogent evidence to disbelieve the same. Uncorroborated evidence of dw-1 is not sufficient to rebut the presumption and to establish that the,audio_32_99.mp3
"cheque was in fact issued in the year 2002. Admittedly, the cheque is drawn on an account of the accused maintained by him with sbm,",audio_32_100.mp3
"whitefield branch, bangalore and it bears his signature. When signature on the cheque is admitted, then handwritings and colour of ink of handwritings on the",audio_32_101.mp3
"cheque become immaterial. The personsociety on the same day. The accused has ... vs.  has placed reliance upon his own oral ... On 1 january,",audio_32_102.mp3
2016,audio_32_103.mp3
"Disbelieved only on mere denial by him. The cheque at ex.p-1 is drawn in favour of the complainant for rs.55,460/-. Sec.118 of the act says",audio_32_104.mp3
that it can be presumed that a cheque is issued for consideration. Sec.139 of the act mandates the court to draw a presumption that a,audio_32_105.mp3
"cheque is issued towards discharge of legally enforceable debt or liability. When these legal presumptions are drawn in favour of the complainant, then it shall",audio_32_106.mp3
"be presumed that the cheque at ex.p-1 was issued by the accused for consideration in favour of the complainant towards legally enforceable debt. But, it",audio_32_107.mp3
"is to be noted that if the complainant discharges his primary burden, then only we can draw such presumptions. In this Cas. , the cheque at",audio_32_108.mp3
"ex.p-1 is issued in the name of the complainant for rs.55,460/-. It is dated 30.3.2013. Ex.p-2 reveals that the cheque was presented for encashment on",audio_32_109.mp3
2.4.2013 and it was dishonoured on 3.4.2013. Ex.p-3 to 5 disclose that the complainant got issued legal notice to the accused on 18.4.2013 by rpad,audio_32_110.mp3
"which returned unserved as ""incomplete address"". The counsel for the accused has argued that the notice was not served on the accused as such no",audio_32_111.mp3
cause of action arose to the complainant to file the complaint. It is to be noted that dw-1 has admitted during cross examination that the,audio_32_112.mp3
"address mentioned in the complaint is his correct address, that there was no house No.  to his house when he borrowed loan and house No. ",audio_32_113.mp3
is allotted about 2-3 years back. These admissions go to show that the notice at ex.p-3 was sent to correct address of the accused by,audio_32_114.mp3
"prepaid postal service. Hence, the notice is deemed to have been served on the accused. The onus shifts upon the accused to prove that there",audio_32_115.mp3
was no chance of service of notice on the said address. The accused has not adduced any evidence in that regard. His admissions go against,audio_32_116.mp3
"his contention. Hence, i hold that there was deemed service of notice upon the accused. The last date mentioned on the cover at ex.p-5 is",audio_32_117.mp3
"27.4.2013. If the said date is considered as the date of deemed service of notice, there was time to pay the amount till 12.5.2013. Cause",audio_32_118.mp3
of action arose for filing the complaint on 13.5.2013. The complainant has filed this complaint on 15.5.2013 which is well within time. Pw-1 has deposed,audio_32_119.mp3
"about the facts averred in the complaint which is corroborated by the contents of ex.p-1 to 7. Thus, the complainant has discharged his primary burden",audio_32_120.mp3
"to prove his Cas. . Hence, the court has to draw legal presumptions u/s 118 and 139 of the act in favour of the complainant. The",audio_32_121.mp3
"said presumptions are in respect of date of drawing of cheque, existence of debt or liability and issuance of cheque towards discharge of debt or",audio_32_122.mp3
"liability as held by Hon'ble  SC  in rangappa vs mohan Cas. . But, the said presumptions are rebuttable presumptions. The accused has to rebut the",audio_32_123.mp3
same by probable defence. Plausible explanation is not sufficient to rebut the presumptions as held by Hon'ble  SC . The accused has to prove his,audio_32_124.mp3
"defence by preponderance of probability. 17. In this Cas. , the accused has admitted the borrowing of loan of rs.25,000/- from the complainant, but he has",audio_32_125.mp3
"contended that entire loan amount is repaid to the complainant, that the cheque in question was delivered to the complainant along with other 9 cheques",audio_32_126.mp3
"as security on the date of loan, that in spite of repayment of entire loan amount, the complainant has not closed the loan account, has",audio_32_127.mp3
"not returned blank signed documents including the cheques and misused the cheque at ex.p-1 without there being any legally enforceable debt, that he is not",audio_32_128.mp3
"liable to pay the amount of cheque. Hence, he has sought for his acquittal from the Cas. . He has examined himself as dw-1, examined his",audio_32_129.mp3
brother and a neighbour as dw-2 and 3 to prove the repayment of amount and to prove his defence. Evidence of dw-4 and contents of,audio_32_130.mp3
"ex.d-1 and 2 are already discussed above. If the accused is able to prove his defence by preponderance of probability, then onus shifts upon thesociety",audio_32_131.mp3
"on the same day. The accused has ... vs.  has placed reliance upon his own oral ... On 1 january, 2016",audio_32_132.mp3
"Presumptions u/s 118 and 139 are drawn in favour of the complainant, loan documents, ledger extract, vouchers and receipts are not necessary. The complainant has",audio_32_133.mp3
produced ledger extract as per the direction of the court given in pursuance of i.a. Filed by the accused. The said document remained unmarked. The,audio_32_134.mp3
"person calling the other party to produce a document is bound to give it in evidence, but the accused has not chosen to get it",audio_32_135.mp3
"marked. Since, the said document is produced by the complainant before the court as per direction given in that regard, it becomes part of the",audio_32_136.mp3
records and its contents can be read in evidence. 18. Dw-1:anand has stated as per his defence. Dw-2:venugopala reddy and dw-3 basavaraj have supported the,audio_32_137.mp3
"version of dw-1 as to payment of all installments by him to the complainant. Pw-1 ravindra has admitted the payment of rs.20,000/- by the accused",audio_32_138.mp3
"on 28.3.2006 in the house of dw-2, but he has denied the repayment of entire loan amount by the accused and retention of blank signed",audio_32_139.mp3
"cheques and other documents, misuse of cheque at ex.p1 and filing of this Cas.  based on misused cheque. Dw-1 has deposed that the complainant has",audio_32_140.mp3
not issued any receipts for the amount paid and he went on postponing to return the documents including the cheques even after payment of entire,audio_32_141.mp3
"dues. The suggestions given to dw-1 to 3 and evidence of pw-1 go to show that repayment of rs.20,000/- on 28.3.2006 is admitted. The said",audio_32_142.mp3
"fact does not require further proof, but payment of 20 installments by the accused is denied by pw-1. Except bare denials, nothing is elicited from",audio_32_143.mp3
"him. Only on the say of dw-1 to 3, it can not be believed that the accused has paid monthly installments regularly for about 20",audio_32_144.mp3
months and the payment made by him on 28.3.2006 was towards full and final settlement. The accused has not produced receipt or counter foil for,audio_32_145.mp3
having paid the amount to the complainant. He has not initiated any legal action against the complainant for filing this complaint on the basis of,audio_32_146.mp3
"forged cheque till this date. He was very much residing in the address shown in the cause title, but the statutory notice was not served",audio_32_147.mp3
"upon him. The conduct of the accused indicates that he was knowing about the dishonour of cheque and in spite of it, he has not",audio_32_148.mp3
"received the notice. There is no reply by the accused for the said notice. Hence, the defence of the accused is baseless and the accused",audio_32_149.mp3
"has failed to raise his defence at the earliest point of time. Even after his appearance before the court, the accused has not made any",audio_32_150.mp3
"efforts to get back his cheques if any, from the complainant. He has not filed any complaint or suit for getting back his cheques and",audio_32_151.mp3
"other documents. Except oral evidence of dw-1 to 3, there is nothing on record to believe that the accused has paid 20 installments regularly prior",audio_32_152.mp3
"to 28.03.2006 and has paid rs.20,000/- on 28.3.2006 towards full and final settlement of his loan account. Hence, i am of the opinion that the",audio_32_153.mp3
defence raised by the accused is improbable and unbelievable. 19. Dw-2:venugopala reddy is none other than the brother of the accused. Dw-3:basavaraj is a neighbour,audio_32_154.mp3
against whom similar cheque bounce Cas.  is filed by the complainant. Their evidence is uncorroborated. Any amount of oral evidence does not equate the documentary,audio_32_155.mp3
"evidence as to payment of amount. Dw-1 and 2 have deposed that in spite of payment of entire dues, the complainant has not returned blank",audio_32_156.mp3
documents and cheques. No prudent man keeps quite under said situation. He ought to have obtained an endorsement regarding closure of account or regarding payment,audio_32_157.mp3
"of amount towards full and final settlement of dues. The accused has not acted like a prudent man. Hence, his evidence as to discharge of",audio_32_158.mp3
entire liability is unbelievable. Dw-3 is a neighbour of the accused who is sailing in the same boat and facing cheque bounce charges by thesociety,audio_32_159.mp3
"on the same day. The accused has ... vs.  has placed reliance upon his own oral ... On 1 january, 2016",audio_32_160.mp3
"Interested to see the acquittal of the accused and hence, oral evidence of dw-2 and 3 is also unbelievable and unreliable. Thus, the accused has",audio_32_161.mp3
"failed to prove his defence as to repayment of entire dues of the complainant. Only on the basis of oral say of dw-1 to 3,",audio_32_162.mp3
it can not be held that the accused was not liable to pay any amount to the complainant as on the date of cheque. The,audio_32_163.mp3
"accused ought to have examined the bill collector of the complainant to prove the payment of installments. He has neither produced receipts, bank statement nor",audio_32_164.mp3
pass book to prove the payment of amount. I am of the opinion that the accused has failed to prove his defence by preponderance of,audio_32_165.mp3
"probability. The rulings relied upon by the accused are not applicable to the facts of this Cas. . Hence, i hold that presumptions raised in favour",audio_32_166.mp3
of the complainant remained unrebutted. The complainant has got marked relevant and necessary documents before the court. He has complied all requirements of sec.138 of,audio_32_167.mp3
"the act. Hence, the complainant need not produce evidence as to proof of transaction, balance due and issuance of cheque. The complainant is the payee",audio_32_168.mp3
named in the cheque. It came to be dishonoured for want of funds. The demand notice was in time and it is deemed to be,audio_32_169.mp3
"served on the accused. In spite of knowing about the dishonour of cheque, the accused has kept quite. Cheque in question was in the custody",audio_32_170.mp3
of the complainant prior to its production before the court. It implies that the amount of loan is not repaid. Uncorroborated testimony of dw-1 to,audio_32_171.mp3

"accused. There is nothing on record to believe that the complainant has misused the blank cheque of the accused to file this complaint. Therefore, i",audio_32_173.mp3
"disbelieve the evidence of dw-1 to 3 as to repayment of entire loan amount by the accused to the complainant. Since, the legal presumptions remained",audio_32_174.mp3
"unrebutted, it can be said that there was legally enforceable debt payable by the accused for the issuance of cheque at ex.p-1. The said cheque",audio_32_175.mp3
came to be dishonoured for insufficient funds. The complainant has demanded the payment of amount of cheque in writing and the notice is deemed to,audio_32_176.mp3
"have been served upon the accused. In spite of it, the accused has not paid the amount of cheque. He has not tendered the amount",audio_32_177.mp3

"by the learned AG  that a majority of cheque bounce cases are indeed being compromised or settled by way of compounding, albeit during the",audio_34_195.mp3

"unlike S.  320 crpc, S.  147 of the NI Act  provides no explicit guidance as to what stage compounding can or cannot be done",audio_34_198.mp3
"and whether compounding can be done at the instance of the complainant or with the leave of the court. 19. As mentioned earlier, the learned",audio_34_199.mp3
"AG 's submission is that in the absence of statutory guidance, parties are choosing compounding as a method of last resort instead of opting for",audio_34_200.mp3

take the chance of progressing through the various stages of litigation and then choose the route of settlement only when no other route remains. While,audio_34_202.mp3
"such behaviour may be viewed as rational from the viewpoint of litigants, the hard facts are that the undue delay in opting for compounding contributes",audio_34_203.mp3

"complaints have been filed, orders for transfer of the complaint to the first court should be given, generally speaking, by the HC  after imposing",audio_34_239.mp3
heavy costs on the complainant for resorting to such a practice. These directions should be given effect prospectively. 24. We are also conscious of the,audio_34_240.mp3
view that the judicial endorsement of the abovequoted guidelines could be seen as an act of judicial law-making and therefore an intrusion into the legislative,audio_34_241.mp3
domain. It must be kept in mind that S.  147 of the act does not carry any guidance on how to proceed with the compounding,audio_34_242.mp3
of offences under the act. We have already explained that the scheme contemplated under S.  320 crpc cannot be followed in the strict sense. In,audio_34_243.mp3
"view of the legislative vacuum, we see no hurdle to the endorsement of some suggestions which have been designed to discourage litigants from unduly delaying",audio_34_244.mp3
the composition of the offence in cases involving S.  138 of the act. 25. The graded scheme for imposing costs is a means to encourage,audio_34_245.mp3
"compounding at an early stage of litigation. In the status quo, valuable time of the court is spent on the trial of these cases and",audio_34_246.mp3
"the parties are not liable to pay any court fee since the proceedings are governed by the Cr.P.C. , even though the impact",audio_34_247.mp3
"of the offence is largely confined to the Pvt.  parties. Even though the imposition of costs by the competent court is a matter of discretion,",audio_34_248.mp3
the scale of costs has been suggested in the interest of uniformity. The competent court can of course reduce the costs with regard to the,audio_34_249.mp3
"specific facts and circumstances of a Cas. , while recording reasons in writing for such variance. Bona fide litigants should of course contest the proceedings to",audio_34_250.mp3
"their logical end."" (emphasis supplied) the apex court while delineating every character of the settlement being arrived at by the accused particularly at the stage",audio_34_251.mp3
of conviction records certain guidelines to be followed by the concerned court while recording compounding of offence. One such direction is that if the Appl. ,audio_34_252.mp3
"for compounding is made before the concerned court or the HC  in revision or appeal, such compounding should be allowed only on a condition",audio_34_253.mp3
that the accused pays 15% of the cheque amount by way of costs. This would be for the reason that the accused demonstrates his bona,audio_34_254.mp3
fides in arriving at a settlement with the complainant. Certain other conditions are also issued by the apex court. The apex court holds that it,audio_34_255.mp3
should be mandatory that the aforesaid amount is made a condition precedent for even considering the Appl.  for compounding of the offence. 12. If the,audio_34_256.mp3
"finding of the apex court or the guidelines laid down therein are considered qua the facts obtaining in the Cas.  at hand, what would emerge",audio_34_257.mp3
"is that the very reference of the Cas.  to the lok adalat is erroneous, as there is nothing recorded by the concerned court that the",audio_34_258.mp3

Adalat runs counter to the judgment of the apex court supra. This is the first threshold of illegality in the reference being made to the,audio_34_261.mp3
lok adalat. What has driven the petitioner to this court is the trauma i.e.  generated in the aftermath of the award. It is no,audio_34_262.mp3
"doubt true that the compromise in terms of law can be executed, as a decree i.e.  to be executed would also include proceedings under",audio_34_263.mp3

the permissibility of the compounding of an offence is linked to the perceived seriousness of the offence and the nature of the remedy provided. On,audio_35_98.mp3

"general that a majority of cheque bounce cases are indeed being compromised or settled by way of compounding, albeit . During the later stages of",audio_35_113.mp3
litigation thereby contributing to undue delay in J. □ delivery. The problem herein is with the tendency of litigants to belatedly choose compounding as a means,audio_35_114.mp3

"of the crpc, S.  147 of the NI Act  provides no explicit guidance as to what stage compounding can or cannot be done and",audio_35_116.mp3
"whether compounding can be done at the instance of the complainant or with the leave of the court. As mentioned earlier, the learned AG 's",audio_35_117.mp3
"submission is that in the absence of statutory guidance, parties are choosing compounding as a method of last resort instead of opting for it as",audio_35_118.mp3

important is that neither S.  138 nor S.  142 or any other provision contained in the act forbids the holder or payee of the cheque,audio_36_66.mp3

"Unpaid, legal notice for demand was issued only on 17.12.2008 which was not within 30 days of the receipt of the information by him from",audio_36_74.mp3
the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. Non-issuance of notice within the limitation prescribed has rendered the complaint as not maintainable. 10.,audio_36_75.mp3
"In msr leathers (supra), this court analyzed the provisions of Ss.  138 and 142 of the n.i. Act in the following manner: □the proviso to",audio_36_76.mp3
"S.  138, however, is all important and stipulates three distinct conditions precedent, which must be satisfied before the dishonor of a cheque can constitute an",audio_36_77.mp3
offence and become punishable. The first condition is that the cheque ought to have been presented to the bank within a period of six months,audio_36_78.mp3
"from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of of its validity, whichever is earlier. The second condition is that the",audio_36_79.mp3
"payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, as the Cas.  may be, ought to make a demand for the payment of the",audio_36_80.mp3
"said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within thirty days of the receipt of information by",audio_36_81.mp3
him from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. The third condition is that the drawer of such a cheque should have,audio_36_82.mp3
"failed to make payment of the said amount of money to the payee or as the Cas.  may, to the holder in due course of",audio_36_83.mp3
the cheque within fifteen days of the receipt of the said notice. It is only upon the satisfaction of all the three conditions mentioned above,audio_36_84.mp3
"and enumerated under the proviso to S.  138 as clauses (a), (b) and (c) thereof that an offence under S.  138 can be said to",audio_36_85.mp3
have been committed by the person issuing the cheque. S.  142 of the NI Act  governs taking of cognizance of the offence and starts,audio_36_86.mp3
"with a non obstante Cl. . It provides that no court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under S.  138 except upon a complaint, in",audio_36_87.mp3
"writing, made by the payee or, as the Cas.  may be, by the holder in due course and such complaint is made within one month",audio_36_88.mp3
of the date on which the cause of action arises under Cl.  (c) of the proviso to S.  138. In terms of Cl.  (c) to,audio_36_89.mp3
"S.  142, no count inferior to that of a MM  or a judicial magistrate of the first class is competent to try any offence",audio_36_90.mp3
punishable under S.  138. A careful reading of the above provisions makes it manifest that a complaint under S.  138 can be filed only after,audio_36_91.mp3
"cause of action to do so has accrued in terms of Cl.  (c) of the proviso to S.  138 which, as noticed earlier, happens no",audio_36_92.mp3
sooner than when the drawer of the cheque fails to make the payment of the cheque amount to the payee or the holder of the,audio_36_93.mp3
cheque within 15 days of the receipt of the notice required to be sent in terms of Cl.  (b) of the proviso to S.  138,audio_36_94.mp3
of the act. The presentation of the cheque and dishonor thereof within the period of its validity or a period of six months is just,audio_36_95.mp3
"one of the three requirements that constitutes □causekamlesh kumar vs.  state of bihar & anr on 11 december, 2013",audio_36_96.mp3
i.e.  more commonly used in Civ.  law than in penal statutes. For a dishonor to culminate into the commission of an offence of which,audio_36_97.mp3
"a court may take cognizance, there are two other requirements, viz. , (a) service of a notice upon the drawer of the cheque to make payment",audio_36_98.mp3
"of the amount covered by the cheque, and (b) failure of the drawer to make any such payment within the stipulated period of 15 days",audio_36_99.mp3
of the receipt of such a notice. It is only when the said two conditions are superadded to the dishonor of the cheque that the,audio_36_100.mp3
"holder/payee of the cheque acquires the right to institute proceedings for prosecution under S.  138 of the act, which right remains legally enforceable for a",audio_36_101.mp3
"period of 30 days counted from the date on which the cause of action accrued to him. Therefore, there is, nothing in the proviso to",audio_36_102.mp3
"S.  138 or S.  142 for that matter, to oblige the holder/payee of a dishonoured cheque to necessarily file a complaint even when he has",audio_36_103.mp3
acquired an indefeasible right to do so. The fact that an offence is complete need not necessarily lead to launch of prosecution especially when the,audio_36_104.mp3
"offence is not a cognizable one. It follows that the complainant may, even when he has the immediate right to institute Crl.  proceedings against the",audio_36_105.mp3
"drawer of the cheque, either at the request of the holder/payee of the cheque or on his own volition, refrain from instituting the proceedings based",audio_36_106.mp3
on the cause of action that has accrued to him. Such a decision to defer prosecution may be impelled by several considerations but more importantly,audio_36_107.mp3
it may be induced by an assurance which the drawer extends to the holder of the cheque that given some time the payment covered by,audio_36_108.mp3
"the cheques would be arranged, in the process rendering a time- consuming and generally expensive legal recourse unnecessary. It may also be induced by a",audio_36_109.mp3
belief that a fresh presentation of the cheque may result in encashment for a variety of reasons including the vicissitudes of trade and business dealings,audio_36_110.mp3
where financial accommodation given by the parties to each other is not an unknown phenomenon. Suffice it to say that there is nothing in the,audio_36_111.mp3
provisions of the act that forbids the holder/payee of the cheque to demand by service of a fresh notice under Cl.  (b) of the proviso,audio_36_112.mp3
"to S.  138 of the act, the amount covered by the cheque, should there be a second or a successive dishonor of the cheque on",audio_36_113.mp3
its presentation.‚ 11. It is thus clear that period of limitation is not to be counted from the date when the cheque in question was,audio_36_114.mp3
"presented in the first instance on 25.10.2008 or the legal notice was issued on 27.10.2008, inasmuch as the cheque was presented again on 10.11.2008. For",audio_36_115.mp3
"the purposes of limitation, in so far as legal notice is concerned, it is to be served within 30 days of the receipt of information",audio_36_116.mp3
"by the drawyee from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid. Therefore, after the cheque is returned unpaid, notice has to be",audio_36_117.mp3
issued within 30 days of the receipt of information in this behalf. i.e.  the period of limitation provided for issuance of legal notice calling,audio_36_118.mp3
upon the drawer of the cheque to make the payment. After the sending of this notice 15 days time is to be given to the,audio_36_119.mp3
"noticee, from the date of receipt of the said notice to make the payment, if i.e.  already not done. If noticee fails to make",audio_36_120.mp3
"the payment, the offence can be said to have been committed and in that event cause ofkamlesh kumar vs.  state of bihar & anr on",audio_36_121.mp3

"Month time from the date of cause of action to file the complaint. 12. Applying the aforesaid principles, in the present Cas. , we find that",audio_36_123.mp3
"cheque was presented, second time, on 10.11.2008. The complainant, however, sent the legal notice on 17.12.2008 i.e. Much after the expiry of the 30 days.",audio_36_124.mp3
It is clear from the complaint filed by the complainant himself that he had gone to the bank for encashment the cheque on 10.11.2008 but,audio_36_125.mp3
the cheque was not honoured due to the unavailability of the balance in the account. 13. The crucial question is as to on which date,audio_36_126.mp3
the complainant received the information about the dishonour of the cheque. As per the appellant the complainant received the information about the dishonour of the,audio_36_127.mp3
"cheque on 10.11.2008. However, the respondent has disputed the same. However, we would like to add that at the time of arguments the aforesaid submission",audio_36_128.mp3
"of the appellant was not refuted. After the judgment was reserved, the complainant has filed the Aff.  alleging therein that he received the bank memo",audio_36_129.mp3
of the bouncing of cheque on 17.11.2008 and therefore legal notice sent on 17.12.2008 is within the period 30 days from the date of information.,audio_36_130.mp3
"Normally, we would have called upon the parties to prove their respective versions before the trial court by leading their evidence. However, in the present",audio_36_131.mp3
"Cas. , as rightly pointed out by the learned Sr.  counsel for the appellant, the complainant has accepted in the complaint itself that he had gone",audio_36_132.mp3
"to the bank for encashment of cheque on 10.11.2008 and the cheque was not honoured due to insufficient of funds, thereby admitting that he came",audio_36_133.mp3
to know about the dishonor of the cheque on 10.11.2008 itself. It is for this reason that appellant has filed reply Aff.  stating that this,audio_36_134.mp3
is an after thought plea as no material has been filed before the court below to show that the bank had issued memo about the,audio_36_135.mp3
return of cheque which was received by the complainant on 17.11.2008. The specific averment made in the complaint in this behalf is as under: □subsequently,audio_36_136.mp3
the complainant again went to encash the cheque given by the accused on 10.11.2008 which again bounced due to unavailability of balance in the accused,audio_36_137.mp3
"account.‚ it is, thus, clear from the aforesaid averment made by the complainant himself that he had gone to the bank for encashing the cheque",audio_36_138.mp3
"on 10.11.2008 and found that because of unavailability of sufficient balance in the account, the cheque was bounced. Therefore, it becomes obvious that he had",audio_36_139.mp3
come to know about the same on 10.11.2008 itself. In view of this admission in the complaint about the information having been received by the,audio_36_140.mp3
"complainant about the bouncing of the cheque on 10.11.2008 itself, no further enquiry is needed on this aspect. 14. It is, thus, apparent that he",audio_36_141.mp3
"received the information about the dishonor of the cheque on 10.11.2008 itself. However, he did not send the legal notice within 30 days therefrom. We,",audio_36_142.mp3

"of the complainant makes it clear that, though the complainant in his complaint and evidence stated that he is engaged in business of poultry farm",audio_37_183.mp3
"and other petty business and having rental income rs.15,000/€ per month and due to the said source of income he had substantial saving to his",audio_37_184.mp3
"credit, but as per his own admission on his cross€ examination he has not produced any documents either to show that he is running poultry",audio_37_185.mp3
farm and other petty business or having rental income as claimed by him. If really the complainant is having sufficient source of income as contended,audio_37_186.mp3
"by him from his poultry farm and other petty business, definitely he would have produced the documents to that effect and even has not produced",audio_37_187.mp3
his bank statement to prove his financial capacity. The complainant in his cross€ examination at one breath stated that earlier he was doing construction work,audio_37_188.mp3
"i.e., (gare work) and poultry farm business butsri. D. Chikkanna vs.  sri. Vishwanath on 28 may, 2021",audio_37_189.mp3
"Was / is running the said business, but Anr.  breath stated that as on the date of request made by the father€in€law of the accused",audio_37_190.mp3
for advancing the loan amount he was not having sufficient funds and requested 2 weeks time to lend the loan amount and he had collected,audio_37_191.mp3
the amount from some other persons to whom he has lend the loan amount and after collecting the said amount out of the said amount,audio_37_192.mp3
he has lend the loan amount in question to the father€in€law of the accused and he is not able to say the name of those,audio_37_193.mp3
persons. Hence it goes to show that the complainant is not specific about his source of income as one breath the complainant in his evidence,audio_37_194.mp3
and complaint stated that out of his income derived from business of poultry farm and other petty business and rental income he has lent the,audio_37_195.mp3
loan amount in question but Anr.  breath has stated that he had collected the amount from some other persons to whom he had lend the,audio_37_196.mp3
"amount and after collecting the said amount he has advance the loan amount in question, therefore the inconsistent statement of the complainant itself creates a",audio_37_197.mp3
"serious doubts with regard financial capacity of the complainant. It really the complainant is having source of income as stated in complaint and his evidence,",audio_37_198.mp3
definitely he would have stated the same fact in his cross€examination. 22. In addition to the above complainant in his complaint and evidence stated that,audio_37_199.mp3
the accused and his father€in€law approached him during the second week of october 2016 and have requested him to help and lend hand loan of,audio_37_200.mp3
"rs.4 lakhs to mr. Subramani to purchase new jcb machine / equipments, accordingly during last week of october 2016 he had paid a hand loan",audio_37_201.mp3
of rs.4 lakhs to mr. Subramani by cash in the presence of the accused and at that time they assured to repay the said amount,audio_37_202.mp3
on or before 31st march 2017. Hence on careful reading of the complaint and evidence of the complainant according to him the accused and his,audio_37_203.mp3
"father€in€law viz., subramani approached him and requested to lend loan of rs.4 lakhs to mr. Subramani for purchase of new jcb machine as the father€in€law",audio_37_204.mp3
"of the accused engaged in hiring out or letting out the jcb machines, equipments on hire/rental basis and carrying on the said business, accordingly he",audio_37_205.mp3
"has lend the rs.4 lakhs to the father€ in€law of the accused, but whereas the complainant in his cross€examination has categorically admitted that he has",audio_37_206.mp3
"not lend any loan amount to the subramani i.e., the father€in€ law of the accused and even has not taken any documents from the said",audio_37_207.mp3
subramani or from the accused for having lend the alleged loan amount of rs.4 lakhs and also admitted that he has not verified the documents,audio_37_208.mp3
with regard to alleged jcb business of the subramani and also admitted that he has given the loan amount to the accused through his father€in€law,audio_37_209.mp3
"mr. Subramani and accused is not carrying jcb business, hence the admissions of the complainant itself goes to show that he has categorically admitted that",audio_37_210.mp3
"he has not lend the loan amount to the father€in€law of the accused, therefore the said admission itself negativates or nullifies the very claim made",audio_37_211.mp3
by the complainant in his complain and his evidence that he has lent an amount of rs.4 lakhs to the father€ in€law of the accused,audio_37_212.mp3
"i.e., mr. Subramani for the purpose of purchasing the jcb machine / equipments. If really the complainant has lent rs.4 lakhs to the father€in€law of",audio_37_213.mp3
"the accused in presence of the accused as hand loan for purchase of the jcb machine / equipments, at least he would have collected the",audio_37_214.mp3
"documents either from the father€in€ law of the accused or if the alleged loan amount lent to the accused through his father€in€law, the complainant would",audio_37_215.mp3
have collected documents from the accused for having lending huge amount of rs.4 lakhs but the complainant has clearly admitted that has not collected any,audio_37_216.mp3
"documents from the father€in€ law of the accused or from the accused, that itself creates a doubt with regard to alleged lending of huge loan",audio_37_217.mp3
"amount of rs.4 lakhs assri. D. Chikkanna vs.  sri. Vishwanath on 28 may, 2021",audio_37_218.mp3
"Insisting a document from the person, while lending of huge loan amount, in such circumstances the alleged lending of huge amount of rs.4 lakhs by",audio_37_219.mp3
the complainant as hand loan either to the father€ in€law of the accused or accused without collecting any documents creates a serious doubts with regard,audio_37_220.mp3
to lending of loan amount in question. In addition to that if really the complainant has lent the alleged loan of rs.4 lakhs to the,audio_37_221.mp3
accused through his father€in€law then the complainant could have stated this fact either in his legal notice or in the complaint or in his evidence,audio_37_222.mp3
but nothing has been stated by the complainant for the first time in his cross€examination has disclosed that he has lent the alleged loan of,audio_37_223.mp3
"rs.4 lakhs to the accused through his father€in€law, therefore the in consistent statement of the complainant creates a doubt with regard to lending of alleged",audio_37_224.mp3
"loan amount to the father€in€law of the accused as claimed by him. It is also relevant to mention that, the complainant in his cross€examination at",audio_37_225.mp3
"one stretch admitted that he has not lend any loan amount to the father€in€law of the accused i.e., mr. Subramani and has lent the loan",audio_37_226.mp3
"of rs.4 lakhs to the accused through his father€in€law i.e., mr. Subramani and Anr.  stretch admitted that the loan amount is required to the father€in€law",audio_37_227.mp3
"of the accused i.e., mr. Subramani , hence it goes to show that if really the father€in€law of the accused was in need of loan",audio_37_228.mp3
"amount and has requested to lend the loan amount to the complainant, in such circumstances the question of lending of the alleged loan of amount",audio_37_229.mp3
"of rs.4 lakhs to the accused doest not arise at all , therefore the admission of the complainant itself creates a doubt as to who",audio_37_230.mp3
"have approached the complainant i.e., whether the accused or his father €in€law have approached and requested to lend the loan amount as claimed by the",audio_37_231.mp3
"complainant, therefore on the basis of inconsistent versions of the complainant it can be held that the complainant has miserable failed to prove that the",audio_37_232.mp3
accused and his father€in€law have approached to him and the father€in€law has requested to lend loan amount of rs.4 lakhs for purchase of new jcb,audio_37_233.mp3
"machine / equipments. 23. It is also relevant to mention that the accused has examined his father€in€law i.e., mr. Subramani as dw3 on his behalf.",audio_37_234.mp3
"The said Mr.  subramani i.e., dw3 in his evidence has clearly stated that himself and complainant are neighbors and he is not doing any chit",audio_37_235.mp3
fund business or owner of jcb equipments and he did not approached the complainant to purchase jcb machine or equipments during the year 2016 and,audio_37_236.mp3
did not required any hand loan amount of rs.4 lakhs and did not received any amount from the complainant during the year 2016 and did,audio_37_237.mp3
not promised the repay the said amount on or before 31.03.2017. The dw3 has also stated the complainant has created false story to purchase the,audio_37_238.mp3
jcb equipments and other machinery for that he and accused approached him seeking hand loan from him. The learned counsel for the complainant has cross€examined,audio_37_239.mp3
the dw3 in length but nothing has been elicited from him to discard or discredit the evidence of dw3. The dw3 has denied the suggestion,audio_37_240.mp3
made to him that he and the accused have approached the complainant seeking financial help for purchase of jcb equipments and the complainant has lent,audio_37_241.mp3
a loan of rs.4 lakhs to the accused during the year 2016 at that time the complainant had collected two cheques from the accused towards,audio_37_242.mp3
the security of loan amount. It is true that the dw3 has admitted in his cross€ examination that he does not know the contents of,audio_37_243.mp3
"the Aff. , but only on that ground the entire evidence of the dw3 cannot be discarded. It is relevant here to mention that it is",audio_37_244.mp3
"an admitted fact by the complainant that the dw3 i.e., subramani is the father€in€law of the accused and as per averments of complaint the complainant",audio_37_245.mp3
"and dw3 are good friends and having cordial relationship among them as they being villagers of gubbalal village since 20 years, in suchsri. D. Chikkanna",audio_37_246.mp3
"vs.  sri. Vishwanath on 28 may, 2021",audio_37_247.mp3
"Some animosity between the complainant and dw3, admittedly nothing has been elicited in the cross€examination of dw3 with regard to animosity or the dw3 having",audio_37_248.mp3
"animosity against the complainant and on the basis of said animosity the dw3 appeared before the court and deposed falsely against the complainant, therefore mere",audio_37_249.mp3
"the dw3 is relative of the accused i.e., father€ in€ law of the accused only on that ground the evidence of the dw3 cannot be",audio_37_250.mp3
discarded. On entire perusal of the cross€examination of the dw3 nothing has been elicited either there is enmity between the complainant and dw3 or any,audio_37_251.mp3
"other circumstances which warrants to discard or disbelieve the evidence of dw3, therefore the evidence of dw3 is sufficient hold that he and accused have",audio_37_252.mp3
not approached the complainant and requested hand loan of rs.4 lakhs for purchase the jcb machine or equipments during year 2016 and the complainant has,audio_37_253.mp3
"paid rs.4 lakhs to the dw3 i.e., subramani father€in€law of the accused and the accused and dw3 have promised to repay the loan on or",audio_37_254.mp3
"before 31.03.2017. Apart from the above it is important to here mention that, the complainant during the course of cross€examination of the dw3 has entirely",audio_37_255.mp3
"changed his version in respect lending of the loan amount in question i.e., the complainant in his legal notice, complaint and evidence has specifically claimed",audio_37_256.mp3
"that he has lent a loan amount of rs.4 lakhs to the father€in€law of the accused i.e., dw3 for purchase of new jcb machine /",audio_37_257.mp3
"equipments in the presence of the accused, but whereas in the cross€examination of dw3 has suggested that the complainant has lent the loan amount of",audio_37_258.mp3
rs.4 lakhs to the accused for the purchase of jcb and at that time the complainant has collected two cheques from the accused towards the,audio_37_259.mp3
"security of loan amount, therefore the very suggestion made to the dw3 itself negativates the claim of the complainant that he has lent alleged amount",audio_37_260.mp3
of rs.4 lakhs to the father€in€law of the accused as claimed in the complaint. 24. Therefore from careful perusal of the entire oral and documentary,audio_37_261.mp3
"evidence of the complainant and admitted facts by the complainant during the course of his cross€examination makes it clear that, the complainant has miserably fails",audio_37_262.mp3
to establish that he was having sufficient source of income to lent the alleged loan amount of rs.4 lakhs and the accused and his father€in€law,audio_37_263.mp3
"have approached him during the year 2016 seeking financial help i.e., hand loan of rs.4 lakhs for the purpose of purchasing new jcb maching /",audio_37_264.mp3
"equipments and the complainant has paid alleged loan of rs.4 lakhs to the father€in€ law of the accused, as claimed by the complainant in his",audio_37_265.mp3
"complaint and his evidence. 25. It is settled law that,the accused in a proceedings u/s.138 of ni act has two options i.e., the accused can",audio_37_266.mp3
"either show that, consideration and debt did not exist or that, under particular circumstances of the Cas.  the non existance of consideration and debt is",audio_37_267.mp3
"so probable that , a prudent man ought to suppose that, no consideration and debt existed and in order to rebut the statutory presumption, accused",audio_37_268.mp3
is not expected to prove his defence beyond reasonable doubt as expected of the complainant in Crl.  trial and the accused may adduce direct evidence,audio_37_269.mp3
to prove that the cheque in question was not supported by consideration and there was no debt or liability to be discharged by him and,audio_37_270.mp3
"the court need not insist in every Cas.  that, the accused should disprove the non existence of consideration that, by leading direct evidence because the",audio_37_271.mp3
existence of negative evidence is neither possible nor contemplated. In this regard it is relevant here refer the decision of Hon'ble  apex court of india,audio_37_272.mp3
"reported in ""laws (SC  ) 2019€8€82 in a Cas.  of sri.dhaneshwarisri. D. Chikkanna vs.  sri. Vishwanath on 28 may, 2021",audio_37_273.mp3
"Hon'ble  apex court held that ""it is well settled that, rebuttal can be made with reference to the evidence of prosecution as well as of",audio_37_274.mp3
"defence"" and in Anr.  decesion reported in (2010) 11 scc 441 in the Cas.  of rangappa vs. Sri.mohan wherein it is held that ""ordinarily in",audio_37_275.mp3
"cheque bounce cases, what the courts have considered is whether the ingredients of the offence enumerated in sec.138 of act have been met and if",audio_37_276.mp3
"so, whether the accused was able to rebut the statutory presumption contemplated by sec.139 of the act and also held that ""it is settled position",audio_37_277.mp3
"that, when an accused has to rebut the presumption u/s.139, the standard of proof for doing so is that of preponderance of probabilities"". Hence, in",audio_37_278.mp3
"view of the principles of law laid down in the above referred decisions, the accused in order to rebut the statutory presumption is not expected",audio_37_279.mp3
to prove his defence beyond all reasonable doubt and the accused may adduce direct evidence to prove his defence or rebuttal can be made with,audio_37_280.mp3
"reference to the evidence of the prosecution and standard of proof for rebuttal of presumption is that of preponderance of probabilities i.e., something which is",audio_37_281.mp3
probable has to be brought on record by the accused. By keeping these principles of law in the mind now let us examine the oral,audio_37_282.mp3
and documentary evidence adduced by the accused as to whether the accused has successfully rebutted the statutory presumptions as against the complainant. 26. The accused,audio_37_283.mp3
"in order to rebut the presumption has himself examined as dw.1. The accused / dw1 in his evidence stated that, his mother by name smt.",audio_37_284.mp3

"he has also paid interest of rs.7,500/€ per month regularly through his mother to the complainant. The accused / dw1 has also stated that, after",audio_37_288.mp3
expiry of six moths the complainant has approached to his mother for repayment of the loan amount at that time his mother requested to extend,audio_37_289.mp3
the time to repay the loan amount and the complainant has returned the 2 filled cheques and requested to give blank signed cheques for the,audio_37_290.mp3

suggestion that he have misused the cheque in question in connivance with the complainant. He further denied the suggestion that he have created various kinds,audio_38_90.mp3
of letters documents without the permission of the accused. He also denied the suggestion that he have misused his power and position in the accused,audio_38_91.mp3
firm and have acted in utter violations in his responsibility. He affirmed that there is a cheque bounce Cas.  pending between him and the accused.,audio_38_92.mp3
He affirmed that settlement which has been placed by him in his Cas.  is not signed by any partner of the accused firm. That he,audio_38_93.mp3
cannot answer who has signed the settlement which has been placed by him in his Cas. . 9. The complainant thereafter closed his evidence. 10. The,audio_38_94.mp3
statement of the accused under S.  313 crpc was then recorded on 09.12.2022. He stated that the documents which have been furnished by cw2 were,audio_38_95.mp3
never authorized by him. That they are forged and fabricated. That the e-mail which have been furnished has no relevance to the present matter. That,audio_38_96.mp3
there exists no due on him with respect to the complainant. That whatever due which he had has already been paid by him to the,audio_38_97.mp3
complainant. That the cheque in question were in possession of the vijay thakur for business purposes since he used to travel abroad and he had,audio_38_98.mp3
"issued instructions that the cheque would not be issued without his knowledge. However, the cheques in question have been misused by vijay thakur. That he",audio_38_99.mp3
"have never given any authorization to anyone. 11. The accused opted to lead his defence evidence, however, on 27.02.2023 he closed his de. 12. Evidences",audio_38_100.mp3
"and documents on record perused carefully. Arguments heard. Law point 13. Before analyzing the material on record, it is imperative to set forth the legal",audio_38_101.mp3
benchmark which governs the adjudication of cases under S.  138 ni act. A bare reading of S.  138 ni act reveals that in addition to,audio_38_102.mp3
"the cheque being issued for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability; following are the ingredients which constitute an",audio_38_103.mp3
offence:- a. That a person drew a cheque on an account maintained by him with the banker; a. That such a cheque when presented to,audio_38_104.mp3
the bank is returned by the bank unpaid; b. That such a cheque was presented to the bank within a period of six months from,audio_38_105.mp3
the date it was drawn or within the period of its validity whichever is earlier; c. That the payee demanded in writing from the drawer,audio_38_106.mp3
"of the cheque the payment of thedharambir vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 25 may, 2023",audio_38_107.mp3

"of the cheque as unpaid. (para 26, n. Harihara krishnan vs.  j. Thomas, (2018) 13 scc 663, referred to in himanshu vs.  b. Shivamurthy (2019)",audio_38_109.mp3
"3 scc 797) 14. S.  138 is to be r/w  the presumption, being a rebuttable presumption, as contained in S.  139. S.  139 provides",audio_38_110.mp3
"that: ""presumption in favour of holder - it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque",audio_38_111.mp3
"of the nature referred to in S.  138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability."" 15. Thus, in",audio_38_112.mp3
"cheque bouncing cases, the judicial scrutiny revolves around the satisfaction of ingredients enumerated under S.  138 ni act and if so, whether the accused was",audio_38_113.mp3
able to rebut the statutory presumption contemplated by S.  139 ni act. S.  139 is an example of reverse onus Cl.  which usually imposes an,audio_38_114.mp3
"evidentiary burden and not a persuasive burden. In other words, evidence of a character, not to prove a fact affirmatively, but to lead evidence to",audio_38_115.mp3
"show non-existence of a liability. Further the law is well settled that when an accused has to rebut the presumption under S.  139, the standard",audio_38_116.mp3
"of proof of doing so is that of ""preponderance of probability"" (rangappa vs.  sri mohan (2010) 11 scc 441). Once execution of cheque is admitted,",audio_38_117.mp3
"it is a legal presumption under S.  139 of negotiable instrument act, the cheque was issued for discharging legally enforceable debt. 16. Attention is also",audio_38_118.mp3
"invited to S.  118(a) wherein a presumption of the cheque having been issued in discharge of a legally sustainable liability and drawn for good consideration,",audio_38_119.mp3
"arises. S.  118 of the n.i act provides:- ""presumptions as to negotiable instruments: until the contrary is proved, the following presumptions shall be made: (a)",audio_38_120.mp3
"of consideration - that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration, and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed, negotiated",audio_38_121.mp3
"or transferred was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for consideration;"" 17. Hence, it can be seen that from its very inception a presumption that the",audio_38_122.mp3
cheque was issued in discharge of a debt or other liability subsists in favour of the complainant and onus rests upon the accused to rebut,audio_38_123.mp3
"the existing presumption on the touchstone of preponderance of probability. 18. Further, the accused in a trial under S.  138 has two options. He can",audio_38_124.mp3
either show that consideration and debt did not exist or that under the particular circumstances of the Cas.  the non-existence of consideration and debt is,audio_38_125.mp3
"so probable that a prudent man ought to suppose that no consideration and debt existed (para 20, kumar exports vs.  sharma carpets (2009) 2 scc",audio_38_126.mp3

"the presumption on the touchstone of preponderance of probabilities. Further, the accused has not lead his defence evidence. However, the law is also well settled",audio_38_137.mp3

forth by the Hon'ble  SC  in c c alavi haji vs.  palapetty muhammed (2007) 6 scc 555. Para 13 & 14 of the judgment,audio_38_153.mp3
"is worth mentioning as under: ""13. According to S.  114 of the act, r/w  illustration (f) thereunder, when it appears to the court that",audio_38_154.mp3
"the common course of business renders it probable that a thing would happen, the court may draw presumption that the thing would have happened, unless",audio_38_155.mp3
"there are circumstances in a particular Cas.  to show that the common course of business was not followed. Thus, S.  114 enables the court to",audio_38_156.mp3
"presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct",audio_38_157.mp3
"and public and Pvt.  business in their relation to the facts of the particular Cas. . Consequently, the court can presume that the common course of",audio_38_158.mp3
"business has been followed in particular cases. When applied to communications sent by post, S.  114 enables the court to presume that in the common",audio_38_159.mp3
"course of natural events, the communication would have been delivered at the address of the addressee. But the presumption i.e.  raised under S.  27",audio_38_160.mp3
"of the g.c. Act is a far stronger presumption. Further, while S.  114 of evidence act refers to a general presumption, S.  27 refers to",audio_38_161.mp3
a specific presumption 14. S.  27 gives rise to a presumption that service of notice has been effected when it is sent to the correct,audio_38_162.mp3
"address by registered post. In view of the said presumption, when stating that a notice has been sent by registered post to the address of",audio_38_163.mp3

I) the accused is a partnership firm. This has been established in view of the consistent position of cw 1 as well as cw 2.,audio_38_174.mp3
"Furthermore, nowhere during the course of the trial the accused has disputed that alkarna is not a partnership firm. Not a single suggestion disputing alkarma",audio_38_175.mp3

has been put by the accused which could directly or indirectly goes on to establish that it is the Cas.  of the accused that the,audio_38_181.mp3
complainant has no connection whatsoever with the accused alkarma firm or that complainant was never an employee of the accused firm. As a matter of,audio_38_182.mp3
"fact, ex cw1/j i.e., proof of appointment and ex cw1/k i.e., proof of salary brought on record by the complaint further cements the position that",audio_38_183.mp3
"the complainant indeed was the employee of accused alkarma firm. 28. In order to rebut the presumption existing in favor of the complainant, the accused",audio_38_184.mp3
through the cross examination and notice under S.  251 crpc attempted to create following line of defence: a) the cheque in question was never issued,audio_38_185.mp3
to the complainant. B) there never existed any settlement between him and the complainant as to the outstanding amount claimed by the complainant. C) the,audio_38_186.mp3

there against him has already been paid by him to the complainant. (statement under S.  313 crpc.)dharambir vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24,audio_38_191.mp3
"on 25 may, 2023",audio_38_192.mp3
251 crpc he only stated that blank signed cheques used to be kept in his office for daily use and the same were taken from,audio_38_193.mp3
"the said office and misused. Here, the accused never even mentioned as to who took the said cheques or when the said cheques were taken.",audio_38_194.mp3
"However, only when the complainant examined cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur, the accused in his statement under S.  313 crpc modified and changed his position",audio_38_195.mp3
and stated that the cheque in question were in possession of vijay thakur and the same have been misused by vijay thakur. 30. During the,audio_38_196.mp3
course of the trial objection was raised with respect to full and final settlement brought on record since the same was not original. The objection,audio_38_197.mp3
"was also decided in favor of the accused. However, mere absence of settlement agreement by itself does not in any manner create probable defence in",audio_38_198.mp3
"favor of the accused, viewed specifically in the light of the fact that the complainant was the employee of the accused firm and further cw1",audio_38_199.mp3
"i.e., the complainant and cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur through their testimony has been able to establish that a settlement was arrived between the accused",audio_38_200.mp3
"firm and the complainant. 31. Furthermore, the accused never initiated any complaint or legal proceedings with respect to the misuse of the cheque. As a",audio_38_201.mp3
"matter of fact, there exists a total of 5 cheques bounce cases pending between the accused and the complainant in the same court. A total",audio_38_202.mp3
of 33 cases are pending against the accused with respect to multiple cheques in the same court. It is highly unnatural and improbable that where,audio_38_203.mp3
"close to three dozen cheque bounce cases have been filed against the accused and he takes a stand that all the cheques have been misused,",audio_38_204.mp3
not a single complaint or legal proceedings or even a stop payment instruction has been initiated by the accused. This conduct of the accused further,audio_38_205.mp3
weakens his line of defence. 32. Anr.  point which is noticeable is that during the cross examination of the complainant as well as cw 2,audio_38_206.mp3
"i.e., vijay thakur, the counsel of the accused took a line of defence that the documents which has been filed on record i.e., settlement, does",audio_38_207.mp3
not bear the signature of the accused and only of vijay kumar cw 2. He has further through the cross examination of the complainant as,audio_38_208.mp3
well as his witness attempted to establish that cw 2 was never authorized by the accused to enter into any settlement with the complainant. This,audio_38_209.mp3
"line of defence also does not hold much water. It stands proved through the testimony of cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur that he was also",audio_38_210.mp3
the employee of accused firm and was working in the position of Sr.  manager. The same also stands proved through the documents which has been,audio_38_211.mp3
brought on record by cw 2 which are on the letter head of the accused firm. 33. Cw 2 further brought on record authorization letter,audio_38_212.mp3
dated 08.01.2018 ex cw2/b which does establish that he was duly authorized. Although the accused did attempt to show that since the settlement was dated,audio_38_213.mp3
"30.11.2017 and whereas the authorization letter ex cw2/b is of 08.01.2017, cw 2 was never authorized to enter into any settlement agreement on behalf of",audio_38_214.mp3
"the accused. However, a plausible explanation to this effect was given by cw 2 in his cross examination that since he was working in continuity",audio_38_215.mp3
with the accused firm he was under directions form the accused to sign mark a and mark b whereas the accused in writing had issued,audio_38_216.mp3
the Auth.  letter to him on 08.01.2018. It is proved that cw 2 has been working in the position of Sr.  manager with accuseddharambir vs. ,audio_38_217.mp3
". M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 25 may, 2023",audio_38_218.mp3
"Further, cw 2 has been working in the accused firm since 1993. In view the abovesaid long tenure and responsible position, the delay of merely",audio_38_219.mp3
a month in the issuance of the authorization letter does not create any reasonable doubt that cw 2 was never authorized by accused sandeep chaudhary,audio_38_220.mp3
"to enter into settlement on behalf of accused firm. 34. Furthermore, a suggestion was put during the cross examination of cw 2 that ex cw2/b",audio_38_221.mp3
"i.e., the authorization letter is forged and fabricated. However, mere suggestion by itself does not prove that the document is forged and fabricated. Something more",audio_38_222.mp3
ought to be brought on record to establish the same. It is not the Cas.  of the accused that he has initiated any Crl.  proceedings,audio_38_223.mp3
with respect to the forging and fabrication of ex cw2/b. No material whatsoever has been brought on record by accused to even suggest the same.,audio_38_224.mp3
"Thus, it stands proved that cw 2 was authorized to enter into settlement agreement on behalf of accused firm with the complainant. 35. The accused",audio_38_225.mp3
had an option to examine himself as a witness which the accused opted not to avail. Where the accused does not examine himself as a,audio_38_226.mp3
"witness, his statement under S.  281 cr. P.c. Or 313 cr. P.c. Cannot be read as evidence of the accused and it has to be",audio_38_227.mp3
looked into only as an explanation of the incriminating circumstance and not as evidence. There is no presumption of law that explanation given by the,audio_38_228.mp3
"accused was truthful (v.S.  yadav vs.  reena 2010 scc online del 3294). In the present matter, in his statement under S.  313 crpc the accused",audio_38_229.mp3
stated that the documents brought by cw 2 were never authorized by him and they are forged and fabricated. If the accused wanted to prove,audio_38_230.mp3
"this, he was supposed to appear in the witness box and testify and get himself subjected to cross examination. Furthermore, nothing came in the cross",audio_38_231.mp3
examination of cw 2 so as to cast any doubt on the documents brought on record by him. 36. During the cross examination of the,audio_38_232.mp3
"complainant, a suggestion was put to the complainant that there is nothing due against the accused/firm and that the complainant has already received his entire",audio_38_233.mp3
"due from the accused when he left the firm. In other words, it is the stand of the accused that he has already paid the",audio_38_234.mp3
"entire due when the complainant left the firm and no due is left against the accused/firm. The same was, however, denied by the complainant. The",audio_38_235.mp3
abovesaid position of the accused further stands corroborated through the statement of the accused under S.  313 crpc wherein the accused stated that whatever due,audio_38_236.mp3
which he had has already been paid by him to the complainant. 37. At this juncture it is pertinent to note that in terms of,audio_38_237.mp3
"S.  1 sub-S.  (4) of payment of wages act, the act is applicable to a factory. Now, the accused firm alkarma is a factory. The",audio_38_238.mp3
"same is proved on perusal of form no 3a i.e., notice of change of manager brought on record by cw 2. 38. S.  13 a",audio_38_239.mp3
of payment of wages act is as follows: [13a. Maintenance of registers and records.--(1) every employer shall maintain such registers and records giving such particulars,audio_38_240.mp3
"of persons employed by him, the work performed by them, the wages paid to them, the deductions made from their wages, the receipts given by",audio_38_241.mp3
"them and such other particulars and in such form as may bedharambir vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 25 may, 2023",audio_38_242.mp3
"(2) every register and record required to be maintained under this S.  shall, for the purposes of this act, be preserved for a period of",audio_38_243.mp3
"three years after the date of the last entry made therein.] 39. Thus, as can be seen S.  13a mandates that an employer shall maintain",audio_38_244.mp3
"registers and records of person employed by him, work performed, wages paid, deductions made, and receipts given. Alkarma being a factory was therefore required to",audio_38_245.mp3
maintain the registers as per the labor legislations. The accused brought no registers maintained by him in this regard. If the stand of the accused,audio_38_246.mp3
"is that he had already paid all the dues to the complainant, he ought to have brought the registers which were maintained by him reflecting",audio_38_247.mp3
"the same, however, the accused brought nothing on record. Thus, adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused firm and further the defence raised",audio_38_248.mp3
"by the accused regarding due payment already been made to the complainant stands rejected. 40. The present matter, as per the memo of parties has",audio_38_249.mp3
been filed against m/s alkarma through its partner sandeep chaudhary. In the complaint there exists a separate averment that accused sandeep chaudhary is partner of,audio_38_250.mp3
"m/s alkarma and was/is looking after day-to-day affairs and is the authorized signatory of the Co. . Further, accused sandeep chaudhary signed on the cheque in",audio_38_251.mp3
question as the authorized signatory of alkarma. Notice under S.  251 crpc was also framed against accused sandeep chaudhary as partner of accused alkarma. It,audio_38_252.mp3
is also not the Cas.  of the accused sandeep chaudhary that he is not the partner or authorized signatory of accused alkarma. In fact the,audio_38_253.mp3
"entire defence of accused sandeep chaudhary was raised on the premise that accused sandeep chaudhary is the partner of accused alkarma. Hence, in the present",audio_38_254.mp3

particulars of his address as shown in ex.p.7 at the time of availment of the loan. Dw.1 has stated in his evidence that he has,audio_39_55.mp3
"informed his residential address to the complainant and he has admitted that he had borrowed the loan of rs.3,50,000/- in the month of march 2008",audio_39_56.mp3

"his contention that he has availed the said loan under development of small scale industries, the Govt.  scheme. Further, it is stated by him that",audio_39_58.mp3
"at the time of availing loan, he had given four cheques i.e., ex.p.2 & p.3 and other two cheques to the complainant as security. Further",audio_39_59.mp3
it is specifically stated by him that he has not received the notice as per ex.p.5. It is also his version that except the signature,audio_39_60.mp3
"at ex.p.2 & p.3, he has not filled the writings in the cheque. Further he has clearly stated that he had not signed ex.p.6 and",audio_39_61.mp3
"the signature found on the said document is not the signature of any of his family members. Further, he has specifically stated that he is",audio_39_62.mp3
residing in the address as shown in ex.p.6. He has produced ex.d.3 his bank statement so as to make out that he had issued the,audio_39_63.mp3
"cheques i.e., ex.p.2 & p.3 in the year 2008 itself. Further he has stated that he had repaid the entire loan amount to the complainant,",audio_39_64.mp3
"therefore, he is not liable to pay cheque amount. Though in the cross-examination, pw.1 has stated that the address shown in ex.p.5 and ex.d.1 as",audio_39_65.mp3

"the loan, he has given his factory address to the complainant. So, the main contention of the accused is that the legal notice had not",audio_39_68.mp3
"been served on him, as it is not served on his proper address. The documents which are produced on behalf of the accused makes out",audio_39_69.mp3
"that the address that could be seen in ex.p.5, p.6 and bank statement do not tally with the documents which are produced on behalf of",audio_39_70.mp3
"the accused. Further, it is also stated by dw.1 that the signature as could be seen in ex.p.6 is not that of any of his",audio_39_71.mp3
"family members. Now, as the offence alleged against accused is under sec.138 of ni act, the main point for consideration is that whether there exists",audio_39_72.mp3
any legally recoverable debt as on the date of cheque and whether ex.p.2 and p.3 cheques are issued towards discharge of the liability. The complainant's,audio_39_73.mp3

"Installment is shown as rs.12,831/-. Further, the statement shows the first installment due from 7.4.2008, emi received and cheque bounced shown on 10.4.2008, cheque bounced",audio_39_75.mp3
"charges are also leveled. In the same way, further in the month of may also, the statement makes out the monthly installment cheque bounced. So,",audio_39_76.mp3
"each installment is for rs.12,831/-. As it is the contention of the complainant that the cheque is issued towards monthly installment, then it should have",audio_39_77.mp3
"been for a sum of rs.12,831/- but ex.p.2 & p.3 is for rs.38,493/- each. Further, it is also disputed on behalf of the accused that",audio_39_78.mp3
he had not at all issued the cheque towards due payment but ex.p.2 and p.3 cheques are issued for the security purpose. If the statement,audio_39_79.mp3
"of account produced by the complainant itself is looked into, i.e.  ex.p.7, as on 11.4.2009, balance due is rs.59,823/-. This amount also includes cheque",audio_39_80.mp3
"bouncing charges on each installment which is leveled on every month. The total cheque amount in ex.p.2 & p.3 comes to rs.76,986/-. So, as on",audio_39_81.mp3

"each for rs.38,493/- which is excess than the due amount, which is not made out. Apart from that, the thing that has to be taken",audio_39_83.mp3
"into consideration in the present Cas.  is that, drawer and payee are one and the same which is also suggested in the cross-examination of pw.1.",audio_39_84.mp3
"In both the cheques, it is noted as follows: "" pay hdfc bank ltd. A/c business loan vijayanarasimha.s."" this vijayanarasimha.S.  is none other than the",audio_39_85.mp3

"was not due for the said amount as on 11.4.2009. 11. Now, the point that has to be taken into consideration is that, as the",audio_39_87.mp3
"offence is urged under sec.138 of ni act, the complainant has to prove the ingredients of sec.138 of ni act. Merely issuance of cheque will",audio_39_88.mp3

"the entire loan amount, as on 11.4.2009 he was not due for payment of rs.76,986/-. The statement of complainant itself makes out that as on",audio_39_90.mp3
"11.4.2009, including the installment of the said month, due amount comes to rs.59,823/-. Further, it is very much made out from the contention of the",audio_39_91.mp3
"complainant itself that the cheques are issued towards installment amount. As such, as each installment amount being rs.12,831/-, how come the accused had issued each",audio_39_92.mp3
"cheque for rs.38,493/- is not forth coming from the evidence of the complainant. So, when the accused had taken a specific contention that the cheques",audio_39_93.mp3
"are not issued towards discharge of liability and as on the date of cheque, the amount due is not amounting to the total amount of",audio_39_94.mp3
"the two cheques, the complainant had failed to prove that the accused was due for a total sum of rs.76,986/- as on the date of",audio_39_95.mp3
"cheque. Further, the complainant had also failed to prove that the cheques issued towards discharge of the debt having dishonoured for 'insufficient funds' and that",audio_39_96.mp3

these cheques should be presented only in that particular month and should not be presented arbitrarily before or after that period. The reason is that,audio_40_95.mp3

"accused is a partnership firm. This has been established in view of the consistent position of cw 1 as well as cw 2. Furthermore, nowhere",audio_44_179.mp3
during the course of the trial the accused has disputed that alkarna is not a partnership firm. Not a single suggestion disputing alkarma not being,audio_44_180.mp3

same stands proved on a co-joint reading and perusal of the cheque in question and notice under S.  251 crpc. The accused sandeep chaudhary has,audio_44_182.mp3
"admitted his signatures on the cheque in question and perusal of the cheque reflects that the same is belong to ""alkarma"" of which sandeep chaudhary",audio_44_183.mp3

complainant used to work for the accused alkarma. This has also not been disputed by the accused. Not a single suggestion or question has been,audio_44_185.mp3
put by the accused which could directly or indirectly goes on to establish that it is the Cas.  of the accused that the complainant has,audio_44_186.mp3
"no connection whatsoever with the accused alkarma firm or that complainant was never an employee of the accused firm. As a matter of fact, ex",audio_44_187.mp3
"cw1/j i.e., proof of appointment and id card brought on record by the complaint further cements the position that the complainant indeed was the employee",audio_44_188.mp3
"of accused alkarma firm. 34. In order to rebut the presumption existing in favor of the complainant, the accused through the cross examination and notice",audio_44_189.mp3
under S.  251 crpc attempted to create following line of defence: (a)the cheque in question was never issued to the complainant.pyara singh vs.  . M/s,audio_44_190.mp3
"alkarma page 1 of 24 on 14 july, 2023",audio_44_191.mp3
Outstanding amount claimed by the complainant. (c)the blank signed cheques were used to be kept in his office for daily use and the same were,audio_44_192.mp3
taken from the said office and misused. (notice under S.  251 crpc.) (d)the cheque in question were in possession of cw2 vijay thakur and the,audio_44_193.mp3
same has been misused by vijay thakur and never gave authorization to anyone regarding the issuance of cheque in question. (statement under S.  313 crpc.),audio_44_194.mp3
(e)whatever documents that have been brought on record by the complainant and his witness are forged and fabricated and were never created by him. (f),audio_44_195.mp3
"whatever due, if any, is there against him has already been paid by him to the complainant. (statement under S.  313 crpc.) 35. The line",audio_44_196.mp3
of defence raised by the accused appears to be incredible. In his notice under S.  251 crpc he only stated that blank signed cheques used,audio_44_197.mp3
"to be kept in his office for daily use and the same were taken from the said office and misused. Here, the accused never even",audio_44_198.mp3
"mentioned as to who took the said cheques or when the said cheques were taken. However, only when the complainant examined cw 2 i.e., vijay",audio_44_199.mp3
"thakur, the accused in his statement under S.  313 crpc modified and changed his position and stated that the cheque in question were in possession",audio_44_200.mp3
of vijay thakur and the same have been misused by vijay thakur. 36. During the course of the trial objection was raised with respect to,audio_44_201.mp3
"full and final settlement brought on record since the same was not original. The objection was also decided in favor of the accused. However, mere",audio_44_202.mp3
"absence of settlement agreement by itself does not in any manner create probable defence in favor of the accused, viewed specifically in the light of",audio_44_203.mp3
"the fact that the complainant was the employee of the accused firm and further cw1 i.e., the complainant and cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur through",audio_44_204.mp3
"their testimony has been able to establish that a settlement was arrived between the accused firm and the complainant. 37. Furthermore, the accused never initiated",audio_44_205.mp3
"any complaint or legal proceedings with respect to the misuse of the cheque. As a matter of fact, there exists a total of 3 cheques",audio_44_206.mp3
bounce cases pending between the accused and the complainant in the same court. A total of 33 cases are pending against the accused with respect,audio_44_207.mp3
to multiple cheques in the same court. It is highly unnatural and improbable that where close to three dozen cheque bounce cases have been filed,audio_44_208.mp3
"against the accused and he takes a stand that all the cheques have been misused, not a single complaint or legal proceedings or even a",audio_44_209.mp3
stop payment instruction has been initiated by the accused. This conduct of the accused further weakens his line of defence. 38. Anr.  point which is,audio_44_210.mp3
"noticeable is that during the cross examination of the complainant as well as cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur, the counsel of the accused took a",audio_44_211.mp3
"line of defence that the documents which has been filed on record i.e., settlement, does not bear the signature of the accused and onlypyara singh",audio_44_212.mp3
"vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 14 july, 2023",audio_44_213.mp3
His witness attempted to establish that cw 2 was never authorized by the accused to enter into any settlement with the complainant. This line of,audio_44_214.mp3
"defence also does not hold much water. It stands proved through the testimony of cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur that he was also the employee",audio_44_215.mp3
of accused firm and was working in the position of Sr.  manager. The same also stands proved through the documents which has been brought on,audio_44_216.mp3
record by cw 2 which are on the letter head of the accused firm. 39. Cw 2 further brought on record authorization letter dated 08.01.2018,audio_44_217.mp3
ex cw2/b which does establish that he was duly authorized. Although the accused did attempt to show that since the settlement was dated 30.11.2017 and,audio_44_218.mp3
"whereas the authorization letter ex cw2/b is of 08.01.2018, cw 2 was never authorized to enter into any settlement agreement on behalf of the accused.",audio_44_219.mp3
"However, a plausible explanation to this effect was given by cw 2 in his cross examination that since he was working in continuity with the",audio_44_220.mp3
accused firm he was under directions form the accused to sign mark a and mark b whereas the accused in writing had issued the Auth. ,audio_44_221.mp3
letter to him on 08.01.2018. It is proved that cw 2 has been working in the position of Sr.  manager with accused alkarma and was,audio_44_222.mp3
"also authorized to issue identity cards to the employees of the accused alkarma. Further, cw 2 has been working in the accused firm since 1993.",audio_44_223.mp3
"In view the abovesaid long tenure and responsible position, the delay of merely a month in the issuance of the authorization letter does not create",audio_44_224.mp3
"any reasonable doubt that cw 2 was never authorized by accused sandeep chaudhary to enter into settlement on behalf of accused firm. 40. Furthermore, a",audio_44_225.mp3
"suggestion was put during the cross examination of cw 2 that ex cw2/b i.e., the authorization letter is forged and fabricated. However, mere suggestion by",audio_44_226.mp3
itself does not prove that the document is forged and fabricated. Something more ought to be brought on record to establish the same. It is,audio_44_227.mp3
not the Cas.  of the accused that he has initiated any Crl.  proceedings with respect to the forging and fabrication of ex cw2/b. No material,audio_44_228.mp3
"whatsoever has been brought on record by accused to even suggest the same. Thus, it stands proved that cw 2 was authorized to enter into",audio_44_229.mp3
settlement agreement on behalf of accused firm with the complainant. 41. The accused had an option to examine himself as a witness which the accused,audio_44_230.mp3
"opted not to avail. Where the accused does not examine himself as a witness, his statement under S.  281 cr. P.c. Or 313 cr. P.c.",audio_44_231.mp3
Cannot be read as evidence of the accused and it has to be looked into only as an explanation of the incriminating circumstance and not,audio_44_232.mp3
as evidence. There is no presumption of law that explanation given by the accused was truthful (v.S.  yadav vs.  reena 2010 scc online del 3294).,audio_44_233.mp3
"In the present matter, in his statement under S.  313 crpc the accused stated that the documents brought by cw 2 were never authorized by",audio_44_234.mp3
"him and they are forged and fabricated. If the accused wanted to prove this, he was supposed to appear in the witness box and testify",audio_44_235.mp3
"and get himself subjected to cross examination. Furthermore, nothing came in the cross examination of cw 2 so as to cast any doubt on the",audio_44_236.mp3
"documents brought on record by him. 42. During the cross examination of the complainant, a suggestion was put to the complainant that there is nothing",audio_44_237.mp3
"due against the accused/firm and that the complainant has already received his entire due from the accused when he left the firm. In other words,",audio_44_238.mp3
"it is the stand of the accused thatpyara singh vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 14 july, 2023",audio_44_239.mp3
"Accused/firm. The same was, however, denied by the complainant. The abovesaid position of the accused further stands corroborated through the statement of the accused under",audio_44_240.mp3
S.  313 crpc wherein the accused stated that whatever due which he had has already been paid by him to the complainant. 43. At this,audio_44_241.mp3
"juncture it is pertinent to note that in terms of S.  1 sub-S.  (4) of payment of wages act, the act is applicable to a",audio_44_242.mp3
"factory. Now, the accused firm alkarma is a factory. The same is proved on perusal of form no 3a i.e., notice of change of manager",audio_44_243.mp3
brought on record by cw 2. 44. S.  13 a of payment of wages act is as follows: [13a. Maintenance of registers and records.--(1) every,audio_44_244.mp3
"employer shall maintain such registers and records giving such particulars of persons employed by him, the work performed by them, the wages paid to them,",audio_44_245.mp3
"the deductions made from their wages, the receipts given by them and such other particulars and in such form as may be prescribed. (2) every",audio_44_246.mp3
"register and record required to be maintained under this S.  shall, for the purposes of this act, be preserved for a period of three years",audio_44_247.mp3
"after the date of the last entry made therein.] 45. Thus, as can be seen S.  13a mandates that an employer shall maintain registers and",audio_44_248.mp3
"records of person employed by him, work performed, wages paid, deductions made, and receipts given. Alkarma being a factory was therefore required to maintain the",audio_44_249.mp3
registers as per the labor legislations. The accused brought no registers maintained by him in this regard. If the stand of the accused is that,audio_44_250.mp3
"he had already paid all the dues to the complainant, he ought to have brought the registers which were maintained by him reflecting the same,",audio_44_251.mp3
"however, the accused brought nothing on record. Thus, adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused firm and further the defence raised by the",audio_44_252.mp3
"accused regarding due payment already been made to the complainant stands rejected. 46. The present matter, as per the memo of parties has been filed",audio_44_253.mp3

"10. The argument advanced on behalf of the complainant-Co.  that the accused in their reply dated september 30, 1990, mentioned that the aforesaid cheque could",audio_54_68.mp3

been postponing the payment even after the said dr. K. V. Surendranath fulfilled his part of promise. The averments made in the complaint further show,audio_58_13.mp3
"that the petitioner-a2 failed to make the payment as per the MOU  dated august 27, 1999, despite several rounds of discussions initiated by",audio_58_14.mp3
"the said dr. K. V. Surendranath. Subsequently, the petitioner-a2 along with al executed an agreement dated april 11, 2000, in favour of dr. K. V.",audio_58_15.mp3

"petitioner, who has been arrayed as a2 in both the cases, can be vicariously made liable along with a1 for the offence punishable under S. ",audio_58_35.mp3
"138 of the act. 9. For brevity and better understanding of the matter, it is expedient at the outset to consider S.  138 of the",audio_58_36.mp3

10. It is also necessary in this context to consider the other S.  141 of the act which makes the partners or the directors also,audio_58_45.mp3
"liable for the acts of the Co.  or the firm, as the Cas.  may be. S.  141 may be extracted hereunder, thus : ""141. Offences",audio_58_46.mp3
"by companies.--(1) if the person committing an offence under S.  138 is a Co. , every person who, at the time the offence was committed, was",audio_58_47.mp3
"in charge of, and was responsible to the Co.  for the conduct of the business of the Co. , as well as the Co. , shall be",audio_58_48.mp3
deemed to be guilty of the offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly : provided that nothing contained in this,audio_58_49.mp3
"sub-S.  shall render any person liable to punishment if he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge, or that he had exercised all",audio_58_50.mp3
"due diligence to prevent the commission of such offence. (2) notwithstanding anything contained in sub-S.  (1), where any offence under this act has been committed",audio_58_51.mp3
"by a Co.  and it is proved that the offence has been committed with the consent or connivance of, or is attributable to, any neglect",audio_58_52.mp3
"on the part of, any director, manager, secretary or other officer of the Co. , such director, manager, secretary or other officer shall also be deemed",audio_58_53.mp3
"to be guilty of that offence and shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished accordingly. Explanation.--for the purposes of this S. ,-- (a) 'Co. '",audio_58_54.mp3
"means any body corporate and includes a firm or other Assn.  of individuals ; and (b) 'director', in relation to a firm, means a partner",audio_58_55.mp3
"in the firm."" 11. A plain reading of S.  138 of the act makes it manifest that if a cheque is drawn by a person",audio_58_56.mp3
on an account maintained by him and issued for the discharge of an existing debt and the cheque bounces either on account of insufficiency of,audio_58_57.mp3
"the funds in the account or on account of a fact that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account, that person",audio_58_58.mp3
is deemed to have committed an offence. The S.  leaves no doubt and makes it manifest that the person who has drawn the cheque on,audio_58_59.mp3
his account is alone liable in the event of that cheque drawn by him having bounced. 12. The act has not envisaged any penal consequences,audio_58_60.mp3
"for the conspiracy, abetment and attempt to commit the said offence. The expressions used in S.  138, viz., ""by a person"", ""on an account maintained",audio_58_61.mp3
"by him"", and ""such person"" make it manifest that the person who has drawn the cheque on an account maintained by him alone is liable.",audio_58_62.mp3
"However, S.  141 of the act envisages a situation where if the person who has drawn the cheque is a juristic person, like a Co. ,",audio_58_63.mp3

"Was in charge of, and was responsible to the Co.  for the conduct of the business of the Co.  is liable. On a perusal of",audio_58_66.mp3
"S.  141 of the act in its entirety, three categories of persons are discernible who are liable for the penal consequences through legal fiction envisaged",audio_58_67.mp3
"in the S. . They are (1) the Co.  which committed the offence, (2) every one who was in charge of and was responsible for the",audio_58_68.mp3
business of the Co.  and (3) any other person who is a director or a manager or secretary or an officer of the Co.  with,audio_58_69.mp3
whose connivance or due to whose neglect the Co.  had committed the offence. I am fortified in my above view by a judgment of the,audio_58_70.mp3
apex court in anil hada vs.  indian acrylic ltd. [1999] 7 scale 209 ; [2000] 99 comp cas 36. It is apposite here to profitably,audio_58_71.mp3
"extract the relevant observation of the apex court in para. 9 of the said judgment thus (page 38) : ""it must be pointed out at",audio_58_72.mp3
the outset that the offender in S.  138 of the act is the drawer of the cheque. He alone would have been the offender thereunder,audio_58_73.mp3
if the act did not contain other provisions. It is because of S.  141 of the act that penal liability under S.  138 is cast,audio_58_74.mp3
"on other persons connected with the Co. ."" 13. Even looking at the background in which the chapter contained Ss.  138 and 141 came to be",audio_58_75.mp3
"Inc. , it is obvious that so as to allow the banking transactions to run smoothly penal consequences have been envisaged. Learned counsel for the petitioner",audio_58_76.mp3
in this regard seeks to rely upon the judgment of this court in g. Surya prabhavathi vs.  nekkanti subrahmanyeswara rao [1997] 2 ald (crl.) 908,audio_58_77.mp3
; [1998] 91 comp cas 223. It has been held in the said judgment that the prosecution can be launched only against the person who,audio_58_78.mp3
is the drawer of the cheque and none else can be prosecuted except the persons envisaged in S.  141 of the act. The invariable conclusion,audio_58_79.mp3
that emerges from the above discussion is that the act has not envisaged any vicarious liability. In the event of the drawer of the cheque,audio_58_80.mp3
being a juristic person the juristic person as well as the persons in charge of and responsible to the juristic person for the conduct of,audio_58_81.mp3
"the business are liable. 14. Sri b. Adinarayana rao, learned counsel also fairly concedes the above legal position. Learned counsel however contends that since a1",audio_58_82.mp3

"seeks to define the expression ""Co. "" by adding an explanation to that S. . Cl.  (a) of the explanation appended under S.  141 is germane for",audio_58_86.mp3
"consideration in this context. According to this Cl.  the Co.  means any body corporate and includes a firm, or other Assn.  of individuals. Laying emphasis",audio_58_87.mp3

"relating to major offences, there is no good reason why it failed to provide for the disclosure of the cases of the same nature of",audio_60_129.mp3
which cognizance has been taken by the court. It is common knowledge that on account of a variety of reasons such as the delaying tactics,audio_60_130.mp3
"of one or the other accused and inadequacies of the prosecuting machinery, framing of formal charges gets delayed considerably, especially in serious cases where committal",audio_60_131.mp3
"procedure has to be gone through. On that account, the voter/citizen shall not be denied information regarding cognizance taken by the court of an offence",audio_60_132.mp3

"minor/non-serious offences while giving direction 2 (vide para 48). If so, the legislative thinking that this distinction should also hold good in regard to past",audio_60_138.mp3

"cannot be faulted merely for the reason that the pro tempore directions of this court have not been scrupulously followed. As regards acquittals, it is",audio_60_145.mp3

"16. S.  138 is to be r/w  the presumption, being a rebuttable presumption, as contained in S.  139. S.  139 provides that: ""presumption in",audio_62_115.mp3

"referred to in S.  138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability."" 17. Thus, in cheque bouncing cases,",audio_62_117.mp3
"the judicial scrutiny revolves around the satisfaction of ingredients enumerated under S.  138 ni act and if so, whether the accused was able to rebut",audio_62_118.mp3
the statutory presumption contemplated by S.  139 ni act. S.  139 is an example of reverse onus Cl.  which usually imposes an evidentiary burden and,audio_62_119.mp3
"not a persuasive burden. In other words, evidence of a character, not to prove a fact affirmatively, but to lead evidence to show non- existence",audio_62_120.mp3
"of a liability. Further the law is well settled that when an accused has to rebut the presumption under S.  139, the standard of proof",audio_62_121.mp3
"of doing so is that of ""preponderance of probability"" (rangappa vs.  sri mohan (2010) 11 scc 441). Once execution of cheque is admitted, it is",audio_62_122.mp3

discharge of a debt or other liability subsists in favour of the complainant and onus rests upon the accused to rebut the existing presumption on,audio_62_129.mp3
"the touchstone of preponderance of probability. 20. Further, the accused in a trial under S.  138 has two options. He can either show that consideration",audio_62_130.mp3

"held by the Hon'ble  SC  as under: ""as the signature in the cheque is admitted to be that of the accused, the presumption envisaged",audio_62_137.mp3

"debt or liability."" 22. Now,in this matter, the accused has admitted his signature. Therefore, the presumption under S.  139 ni act does get raised in",audio_62_140.mp3
"favor of the complainant and against the accused. Thus, the accused now has to rebut the presumption on the touchstone of preponderance of probabilities. Further,",audio_62_141.mp3
"the accused has not lead his defence evidence. However, the law is also well settled that the accused in order to rebut the presumption need",audio_62_142.mp3
not to step into the witness box or lead his defence evidence. The accused can through the material brought on record by the complainant can,audio_62_143.mp3

"Before noting the line of defence of the accused that can be deduced through the cross examination of the complainant witnesses, it is apposite to",audio_62_177.mp3
note the admitted facts in the present matter: a) the accused is a partnership firm. This has been established in view of the consistent position,audio_62_178.mp3
"of cw 1 as well as cw 2. Furthermore, nowhere during the course of the trial the accused has disputed that alkarna is not a",audio_62_179.mp3
partnership firm. Not a single suggestion disputing alkarma not being a partnership firm has been put forth by the accused. B) accused sandeep chaudhary is,audio_62_180.mp3
the partner and authorized signatory of accused alkarma firm. The same stands proved on a co-joint reading and perusal of the cheque in question and,audio_62_181.mp3
notice under S.  251 crpc. The accused sandeep chaudhary has admitted his signatures on the cheque in question and perusal of the cheque reflects that,audio_62_182.mp3
"the same is belong to ""alkarma"" of which sandeep chaudhary is the authorized signatory. Furthermore, it is also not the Cas.  of the accused that",audio_62_183.mp3
he is not the authorized signatory/partner of accused alkarma. C) complainant used to work for the accused alkarma. This has also not been disputed by,audio_62_184.mp3
the accused. Not a single suggestion or question has been put by the accused which could directly or indirectly goes on to establish that it,audio_62_185.mp3
is the Cas.  of the accused that the complainant has no connection whatsoever with the accused alkarma firm or that complainant was never an employee,audio_62_186.mp3
"of the accused firm. As a matter of fact, ex cw1/j i.e., proof of appointment and ex cw1/k i.e., proof of salary brought on record",audio_62_187.mp3
by the complaint further cements the position that the complainant indeed was the employee of accused alkarma firm. 30. In order to rebut the presumption,audio_62_188.mp3
"existing in favor of the complainant, the accused through the cross examination and notice under S.  251 crpc attempted to create following line of defence:",audio_62_189.mp3
"a) the cheque in question was never issued to the complainant.manan vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 8 june, 2023",audio_62_190.mp3
Outstanding amount claimed by the complainant. C) the blank signed cheques were used to be kept in his office for daily use and the same,audio_62_191.mp3
were taken from the said office and misused. (notice under S.  251 crpc.) d) the cheque in question were in possession of cw2 vijay thakur,audio_62_192.mp3
and the same has been misused by vijay thakur and never gave authorization to anyone regarding the issuance of cheque in question. (statement under S. ,audio_62_193.mp3
313 crpc.) e) whatever documents that have been brought on record by the complainant and his witness are forged and fabricated and were never created,audio_62_194.mp3
"by him. F) whatever due, if any, is there against him has already been paid by him to the complainant. (statement under S.  313 crpc.)",audio_62_195.mp3
31. The line of defence raised by the accused appears to be incredible. In his notice under S.  251 crpc he only stated that blank,audio_62_196.mp3
"signed cheques used to be kept in his office for daily use and the same were taken from the said office and misused. Here, the",audio_62_197.mp3
"accused never even mentioned as to who took the said cheques or when the said cheques were taken. However, only when the complainant examined cw",audio_62_198.mp3
"2 i.e., vijay thakur, the accused in his statement under S.  313 crpc modified and changed his position and stated that the cheque in question",audio_62_199.mp3
were in possession of vijay thakur and the same have been misused by vijay thakur. 32. During the course of the trial objection was raised,audio_62_200.mp3
with respect to full and final settlement brought on record since the same was not original. The objection was also decided in favor of the,audio_62_201.mp3
"accused. However, mere absence of settlement agreement by itself does not in any manner create probable defence in favor of the accused, viewed specifically in",audio_62_202.mp3
"the light of the fact that the complainant was the employee of the accused firm and further cw1 i.e., the complainant and cw 2 i.e.,",audio_62_203.mp3
"vijay thakur through their testimony has been able to establish that a settlement was arrived between the accused firm and the complainant. 33. Furthermore, the",audio_62_204.mp3
"accused never initiated any complaint or legal proceedings with respect to the misuse of the cheque. As a matter of fact, there exists a total",audio_62_205.mp3
of 5 cheques bounce cases pending between the accused and the complainant in the same court. A total of 33 cases are pending against the,audio_62_206.mp3
accused with respect to multiple cheques in the same court. It is highly unnatural and improbable that where close to three dozen cheque bounce cases,audio_62_207.mp3
"have been filed against the accused and he takes a stand that all the cheques have been misused, not a single complaint or legal proceedings",audio_62_208.mp3
or even a stop payment instruction has been initiated by the accused. This conduct of the accused further weakens his line of defence.manan vs.  .,audio_62_209.mp3
"M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 8 june, 2023",audio_62_210.mp3
"Well as cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur, the counsel of the accused took a line of defence that the documents which has been filed on",audio_62_211.mp3
"record i.e., settlement, does not bear the signature of the accused and only of vijay kumar cw 2. He has further through the cross examination",audio_62_212.mp3
of the complainant as well as his witness attempted to establish that cw 2 was never authorized by the accused to enter into any settlement,audio_62_213.mp3
"with the complainant. This line of defence also does not hold much water. It stands proved through the testimony of cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur",audio_62_214.mp3
that he was also the employee of accused firm and was working in the position of Sr.  manager. The same also stands proved through the,audio_62_215.mp3
documents which has been brought on record by cw 2 which are on the letter head of the accused firm. 35. Cw 2 further brought,audio_62_216.mp3
on record authorization letter dated 08.01.2018 ex cw2/b which does establish that he was duly authorized. Although the accused did attempt to show that since,audio_62_217.mp3
"the settlement was dated 30.11.2017 and whereas the authorization letter ex cw2/b is of 08.01.2017, cw 2 was never authorized to enter into any settlement",audio_62_218.mp3
"agreement on behalf of the accused. However, a plausible explanation to this effect was given by cw 2 in his cross examination that since he",audio_62_219.mp3
was working in continuity with the accused firm he was under directions form the accused to sign mark a and mark b whereas the accused,audio_62_220.mp3
in writing had issued the Auth.  letter to him on 08.01.2018. It is proved that cw 2 has been working in the position of Sr. ,audio_62_221.mp3
"manager with accused alkarma and was also authorized to issue identity cards to the employees of the accused alkarma. Further, cw 2 has been working",audio_62_222.mp3
"in the accused firm since 1993. In view the abovesaid long tenure and responsible position, the delay of merely a month in the issuance of",audio_62_223.mp3
the authorization letter does not create any reasonable doubt that cw 2 was never authorized by accused sandeep chaudhary to enter into settlement on behalf,audio_62_224.mp3
"of accused firm. 36. Furthermore, a suggestion was put during the cross examination of cw 2 that ex cw2/b i.e., the authorization letter is forged",audio_62_225.mp3
"and fabricated. However, mere suggestion by itself does not prove that the document is forged and fabricated. Something more ought to be brought on record",audio_62_226.mp3
to establish the same. It is not the Cas.  of the accused that he has initiated any Crl.  proceedings with respect to the forging and,audio_62_227.mp3
"fabrication of ex cw2/b. No material whatsoever has been brought on record by accused to even suggest the same. Thus, it stands proved that cw",audio_62_228.mp3
2 was authorized to enter into settlement agreement on behalf of accused firm with the complainant. 37. The accused had an option to examine himself,audio_62_229.mp3
"as a witness which the accused opted not to avail. Where the accused does not examine himself as a witness, his statement under S.  281",audio_62_230.mp3
cr. P.c. Or 313 cr. P.c. Cannot be read as evidence of the accused and it has to be looked into only as an explanation,audio_62_231.mp3
of the incriminating circumstance and not as evidence. There is no presumption of law that explanation given by the accused was truthful (v.S.  yadav vs. ,audio_62_232.mp3
"reena 2010 scc online del 3294). In the present matter, in his statement under S.  313 crpc the accused stated that the documents brought by",audio_62_233.mp3
"cw 2 were never authorized by him and they are forged and fabricated. If the accused wanted to prove this, he was supposed to appear",audio_62_234.mp3
"in the witness box and testify and get himself subjected to cross examination. Furthermore, nothing came in the cross examination of cw 2 so as",audio_62_235.mp3
"to cast any doubt on the documents brought on record by him.manan vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1 of 24 on 8 june, 2023",audio_62_236.mp3
There is nothing due against the accused/firm and that the complainant has already received his entire due from the accused when he left the firm.,audio_62_237.mp3
"In other words, it is the stand of the accused that he has already paid the entire due when the complainant left the firm and",audio_62_238.mp3
"no due is left against the accused/firm. The same was, however, denied by the complainant. The abovesaid position of the accused further stands corroborated through",audio_62_239.mp3
the statement of the accused under S.  313 crpc wherein the accused stated that whatever due which he had has already been paid by him,audio_62_240.mp3
"to the complainant. 39. At this juncture it is pertinent to note that in terms of S.  1 sub-S.  (4) of payment of wages act,",audio_62_241.mp3
"the act is applicable to a factory. Now, the accused firm alkarma is a factory. The same is proved on perusal of form no 3a",audio_62_242.mp3
"i.e., notice of change of manager brought on record by cw 2. 40. S.  13 a of payment of wages act is as follows: [13a.",audio_62_243.mp3
"Maintenance of registers and records.--(1) every employer shall maintain such registers and records giving such particulars of persons employed by him, the work performed by",audio_62_244.mp3
"them, the wages paid to them, the deductions made from their wages, the receipts given by them and such other particulars and in such form",audio_62_245.mp3
"as may be prescribed. (2) every register and record required to be maintained under this S.  shall, for the purposes of this act, be preserved",audio_62_246.mp3
"for a period of three years after the date of the last entry made therein.] 41. Thus, as can be seen S.  13a mandates that",audio_62_247.mp3
"an employer shall maintain registers and records of person employed by him, work performed, wages paid, deductions made, and receipts given. Alkarma being a factory",audio_62_248.mp3
was therefore required to maintain the registers as per the labor legislations. The accused brought no registers maintained by him in this regard. If the,audio_62_249.mp3
"stand of the accused is that he had already paid all the dues to the complainant, he ought to have brought the registers which were",audio_62_250.mp3
"maintained by him reflecting the same, however, the accused brought nothing on record. Thus, adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused firm and",audio_62_251.mp3
"further the defence raised by the accused regarding due payment already been made to the complainant stands rejected. 42. The present matter, as per the",audio_62_252.mp3
memo of parties has been filed against m/s alkarma through its partner sandeep chaudhary. In the complaint there exists a separate averment that accused sandeep,audio_62_253.mp3
"chaudhary is partner of m/s alkarma and was/is looking after day-to-day affairs and is the authorized signatory of the Co. . Further, accused sandeep chaudhary signed",audio_62_254.mp3
on the cheque in question as the authorized signatory of alkarma. Notice under S.  251 crpc was also framed against accused sandeep chaudhary as partner,audio_62_255.mp3
of accused alkarma. It is also not the Cas.  of the accused sandeep chaudhary that he is not the partner or authorized signatory of accused,audio_62_256.mp3

been drawn for the purpose of Cl.  (a) of the proviso to S.  138 of the act. The act as such does not contain any,processed_document_pdf_42326_63.mp3

"date, the condition in Cl.  (a) of the proviso to S.  138 of the act is not satisfied. 9. In considering the said aspect, it",processed_document_pdf_42326_68.mp3

"it bears though, in between the date of delivery and the date it bears, the same is negotiable. But the drawee is not bound to",processed_document_pdf_42326_81.mp3
honour it on any date prior to the date it bears. 11. Interpretation of S.  138 of the act to discover the liability arising from,processed_document_pdf_42326_82.mp3
dishonouring of a post-dated cheque has to be with due regard to the said character of a post-dated cheque and the scope of Cl.  (a),processed_document_pdf_42326_83.mp3
of the proviso to S.  138 cannot be considered in isolation. The statute has to be construed with reference to the context and other clauses,processed_document_pdf_42326_84.mp3
of the act to make it consistent. The very object of the provision is to enhance the acceptability of cheques by making the drawer liable,processed_document_pdf_42326_85.mp3
for penalty in Cas.  the cheque bounces for the reason mentioned in the said S. . If a post-dated cheque is considered to be drawn on,processed_document_pdf_42326_86.mp3
"the date of its deliver)', the drawer of such a cheque can defeat S.  138 of the act, by showing a date beyond six months",processed_document_pdf_42326_87.mp3
"of its delivery. In the circumstances, an interpretation which will bring about such a result cannot be adopted. The object of the S.  is to",processed_document_pdf_42326_88.mp3
make the drawer of the cheque subject to penalty when the cheque bounces on the ground mentioned in the S. . The rigour of the S. ,processed_document_pdf_42326_89.mp3
itself reveals the intention of the legislature. Enough safeguards are provided in the S.  itself to protect honest drawers. 12. An offence under S.  138,processed_document_pdf_42326_90.mp3
of the act would be committed only when a cheque drawn for payment of any debt or liability is returned by the bank unpaid and,processed_document_pdf_42326_91.mp3
the drawer fails to make payment of the said amount within 15 days of the notice of dishonour. One of the elements to be satisfied,processed_document_pdf_42326_92.mp3
is that the cheque should have been returned unpaid. It goes without saying that such return of the cheque by the drawee could only be,processed_document_pdf_42326_93.mp3
"on presentation ; i.e.  when he is capable of presenting the same for encashment. In the Cas.  of a post-dated cheque, as noted earlier,",processed_document_pdf_42326_94.mp3
the same can be presented only on or after the date of the cheque. 13. The question as to when a post-dated cheque can be,processed_document_pdf_42326_95.mp3

attempted to create following line of defence: a) the cheque in question was never issued to the complainant. B) there never existed any settlement between,processed_document_pdf_116482990_191.mp3
him and the complainant as to the outstanding amount claimed by the complainant. C) the blank signed cheques were used to be kept in his,processed_document_pdf_116482990_192.mp3
office for daily use and the same were taken from the said office and misused. (notice under S.  251 crpc.) d) the cheque in question,processed_document_pdf_116482990_193.mp3
were in possession of cw2 vijay thakur and the same has been misused by vijay thakur and never gave authorization to anyone regarding the issuance,processed_document_pdf_116482990_194.mp3
of cheque in question. (statement under S.  313 crpc.) e) whatever documents that have been brought on record by the complainant and his witness are,processed_document_pdf_116482990_195.mp3
"forged and fabricated and were never created by him. F) whatever due, if any, is there against him has already been paid by him to",processed_document_pdf_116482990_196.mp3
the complainant. (statement under S.  313 crpc.) 31. The line of defence raised by the accused appears to be incredible. In his notice under S. ,processed_document_pdf_116482990_197.mp3
251 crpc he only stated that blank signed cheques used to be kept in his office for daily use and the same were taken from,processed_document_pdf_116482990_198.mp3
"the said office and misused. Here, the accused never even mentioned as to who took the said cheques or when the said cheques were taken.",processed_document_pdf_116482990_199.mp3
"However, only when the complainant examined cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur, the accused in his statement under S.  313 crpc modified and changed his position",processed_document_pdf_116482990_200.mp3
and stated that the cheque in question were in possession of vijay thakur and the same have been misused by vijay thakur. 32. During the,processed_document_pdf_116482990_201.mp3
course of the trial objection was raised with respect to full and final settlement brought on record since the same was not original. The objection,processed_document_pdf_116482990_202.mp3
"was also decided in favor of the accused. However, mere absence of settlement agreement by itself does not in any manner create probable defence in",processed_document_pdf_116482990_203.mp3

total of 5 cheques bounce cases pending between the accused and the complainant in the same court. A total of 33 cases are pending against,processed_document_pdf_116482990_208.mp3
the accused with respect to multiple cheques in the same court. It is highly unnatural and improbable that where close to three dozen cheque bounce,processed_document_pdf_116482990_209.mp3
"cases have been filed against the accused and he takes a stand that all the cheques have been misused, not a single complaint or legal",processed_document_pdf_116482990_210.mp3

accused and only of vijay kumar cw 2. He has further through the cross examination of the complainant as well as his witness attempted to,processed_document_pdf_116482990_214.mp3
establish that cw 2 was never authorized by the accused to enter into any settlement with the complainant. This line of defence also does not,processed_document_pdf_116482990_215.mp3
"hold much water. It stands proved through the testimony of cw 2 i.e., vijay thakur that he was also the employee of accused firm and",processed_document_pdf_116482990_216.mp3
was working in the position of Sr.  manager. The same also stands proved through the documents which has been brought on record by cw 2,processed_document_pdf_116482990_217.mp3
which are on the letter head of the accused firm. 35. Cw 2 further brought on record authorization letter dated 08.01.2018 ex cw2/b which does,processed_document_pdf_116482990_218.mp3
establish that he was duly authorized. Although the accused did attempt to show that since the settlement was dated 30.11.2017 and whereas the authorization letter,processed_document_pdf_116482990_219.mp3
"ex cw2/b is of 08.01.2017, cw 2 was never authorized to enter into any settlement agreement on behalf of the accused. However, a plausible explanation",processed_document_pdf_116482990_220.mp3
to this effect was given by cw 2 in his cross examination that since he was working in continuity with the accused firm he was,processed_document_pdf_116482990_221.mp3

08.01.2018. It is proved that cw 2 has been working in the position of Sr.  manager with accused alkarma and was also authorized to issue,processed_document_pdf_116482990_223.mp3
"identity cards to the employees of the accused alkarma. Further, cw 2 has been working in the accused firm since 1993. In view the abovesaid",processed_document_pdf_116482990_224.mp3
"long tenure and responsible position, the delay of merely a month in the issuance of the authorization letter does not create any reasonable doubt that",processed_document_pdf_116482990_225.mp3
"cw 2 was never authorized by accused sandeep chaudhary to enter into settlement on behalf of accused firm. 36. Furthermore, a suggestion was put during",processed_document_pdf_116482990_226.mp3
"the cross examination of cw 2 that ex cw2/b i.e., the authorization letter is forged and fabricated. However, mere suggestion by itself does not prove",processed_document_pdf_116482990_227.mp3
that the document is forged and fabricated. Something more ought to be brought on record to establish the same. It is not the Cas.  of,processed_document_pdf_116482990_228.mp3
the accused that he has initiated any Crl.  proceedings with respect to the forging and fabrication of ex cw2/b. No material whatsoever has been brought,processed_document_pdf_116482990_229.mp3
"on record by accused to even suggest the same. Thus, it stands proved that cw 2 was authorized tomanan vs.  . M/s alkarma page 1",processed_document_pdf_116482990_230.mp3
"of 24 on 8 june, 2023",processed_document_pdf_116482990_231.mp3
37. The accused had an option to examine himself as a witness which the accused opted not to avail. Where the accused does not examine,processed_document_pdf_116482990_232.mp3
"himself as a witness, his statement under S.  281 cr. P.c. Or 313 cr. P.c. Cannot be read as evidence of the accused and it",processed_document_pdf_116482990_233.mp3
has to be looked into only as an explanation of the incriminating circumstance and not as evidence. There is no presumption of law that explanation,processed_document_pdf_116482990_234.mp3
"given by the accused was truthful (v.S.  yadav vs.  reena 2010 scc online del 3294). In the present matter, in his statement under S.  313",processed_document_pdf_116482990_235.mp3
crpc the accused stated that the documents brought by cw 2 were never authorized by him and they are forged and fabricated. If the accused,processed_document_pdf_116482990_236.mp3
"wanted to prove this, he was supposed to appear in the witness box and testify and get himself subjected to cross examination. Furthermore, nothing came",processed_document_pdf_116482990_237.mp3
in the cross examination of cw 2 so as to cast any doubt on the documents brought on record by him. 38. During the cross,processed_document_pdf_116482990_238.mp3
"examination of the complainant, a suggestion was put to the complainant that there is nothing due against the accused/firm and that the complainant has already",processed_document_pdf_116482990_239.mp3
"received his entire due from the accused when he left the firm. In other words, it is the stand of the accused that he has",processed_document_pdf_116482990_240.mp3
"already paid the entire due when the complainant left the firm and no due is left against the accused/firm. The same was, however, denied by",processed_document_pdf_116482990_241.mp3
the complainant. The abovesaid position of the accused further stands corroborated through the statement of the accused under S.  313 crpc wherein the accused stated,processed_document_pdf_116482990_242.mp3
that whatever due which he had has already been paid by him to the complainant. 39. At this juncture it is pertinent to note that,processed_document_pdf_116482990_243.mp3
"in terms of S.  1 sub-S.  (4) of payment of wages act, the act is applicable to a factory. Now, the accused firm alkarma is",processed_document_pdf_116482990_244.mp3
